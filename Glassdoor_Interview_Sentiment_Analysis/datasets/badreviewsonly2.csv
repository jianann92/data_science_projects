First round of interview went well! While the second round of interview was conducted by one of the ops manager from byte dance. She was rude and also was not at all concentrating or rather I would say bother to hear to the answers which I was saying. She was always busy with her phone and laptop and asking me to wait for 2 seconds keeping me on hold. Although there was also an Internet issue from my end! She was not in a position to listen and adjusting her hair looking into the camera! It was rather not professional but it was more of attitude and after almost an hour of interviewing me with multiple questions she has told that she would reschedule my interview for later point of time bcz she could neither accept nor reject my application!, Lot of interview questions on my current company rather than getting to know me it was more like what my client was upto.

"Interviewed for the position of HR Business Partner, Singapore. The interviewer was based in Beijing. Firstly he was late to the interview, didn't have basic courtesy to apologize. Sat down in a room with very dim lights and the camera was too far away where I could barely even see his face. The overall video call set-up was really poor, given that its a so called tech start-up!!Interviewer didn't even introduce himself or say a civilized hello greeting upon starting the interview. Absolute uncultured, unprofessional and arrogant prude. BUCK UP ByteDance!

"ByteDance contacted me through a staffing agency. They needed an engineer for a Warsaw office. Overall there were 3 interviews (all remote via zoom): 1 with an engineer from Warsaw, another - with VP of engineering and the last one with a team lead from China.

"The Interview process took 4 weeks time. I applied via Linkedin and with constant follow up of 2 weeks got their first call. They will have telephonic round first and will from Beijing and post that there will be second round which is VC round with normal conversation. The interviewer is rude and it seems he is not even prepared for interview and most of the time he is lost somewhere and half sleeping. About the 3rd round - was again with some HR official in a VC. Communication in English - Worst! I had tough time to understand chinese english. Interviewers looked confused and the questions were for freshers level. They were just like dummy and looked tired to speak even,Overall this is not the way they should interview.",1.Go through your experience. 2.

"Applied the position online and very soon the recruiter called me, but clearly she is a very junior one (maybe intern?) and not clear about this role at all. When I went to the onsite interview, it's totally a disaster. Firstly I waited for more than 10 minutes until someone come to me without preparation, just asked my resume experience, and that guy said we are not sure if there is a suitable position for you, but will get you interviewed for another round in another office.

They were the one, who picked the date and time, and on the interview day we needed to postopne it in the middle because apparently HR person went home. I didn't find it very proffessional. So we had the second part in two next days and the day after I received an offer, but I never accepted it. I specifically asked the question about the shifts and on both stages I received totally opposite answers.
