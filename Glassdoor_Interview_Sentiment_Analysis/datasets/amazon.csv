I was interviewed by someone new to advertising field and was mostly asked behavioral question and told to strictly adhere to their ""STAR"" method. Although i prepared examples to match their leadership principles using the STAR method it still felt as though i was being tested on how well i could conform my behavior and line of thinking to the ""amazon way' and not being assessed on the skills and applicable experience i bring to the table. If you're comfortable conforming for the sake of working for a large brand such as amazon then this shouldn't be a problem, but the process itself felt robotic and cold which leads me to believe that the experience i would have had if i received an offer would've been the same."," Tell me about a time when you had to complete a task outside of the responsibilities of your role?

No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,, NDA signed. Technical questions are extremely deep.   ,Amazon
No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I was contacted by a recruiter out of the blue, who put me in for a principal solutions architecture role. Made big promises of high salaries/benefits. I took a test that was about 2 hours long. Its a very easy test that mimics a work environment. My opinion is that this test is designed as a bit of a cultural screening, as people who are not native english speakers would find it challenging. I got a very high score and was allowed to proceed on to the ""loop"". I had reservations about the process because in this style of interviewing the candidates are sort of ""forced"" upon the management team, and they are not always serious about hiring. The first recruiter sent me to a second recruiter, who tried a bait and switch approach, telling me that this was not a principal role and busting the salary down far below what the original recruiter stated. After a few weeks I proceeded on to the ""loop"" which was a 7 hour interview marathon. Amazon touts itself as focusing on writing, critical thinking and intelligence, but the technical interview was clearly focused on parochial skills. Simple questions like ""name a database"", ""describe database types"", that sort of thing. They will ask you things that are not on your resume but since its all remote, you can easily pull the answers up on google without them noticing if you are adept enough. They tout the solutions architect role as being a ""field CTO"" which was appealing, but realistically it is nothing more than a ""glorified sysadmin"" job in my opinion, based on the questions they asked and the kind of focus the job had. They asked a few of the typical behavioral questions, and you're supposed to follow the STAR method of responding. However, I noticed they went off this script quite often and it didn't seem to matter in my case. Whenever I asked a question, the hiring manager and sales guy had rambling, incoherent responses - something they won't accept from their candidates. Just be advised that you are being held to a higher standard than they are during the interview. The hiring manager in this case was subordinate to me at a previous company, which I gather was a big reason for me not getting an offer. Of course these kinds of facts were completely lost on the recruiters. The ""senior"" hiring manager only had two years of management experience, and had only been at AWS one year. The interview was easy, but long and time consuming - requiring preparing a presentation ahead of time. I was had more experience, education, training, and IQ than the hiring manager, so it was a no-go from the get go for me. That's really the recruiter's fault. After all that work, all I got was a voice mail from the recruiter that they would not move forward. Of course, she was out of the office that week. Big waste of time. Remember, they're getting paid to talk to you, you aren't.",,Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I had a contact at Amazon that I reached out to regarding an account manager posting. To their credit, they moved me fairly quickly through a conversation with the hiring manager, a formal interview with a team member, than the final round of interviews over video with multiple company employees as well as an Amazon employee on another team. They have a very specific interview process. You must answer every question in STAR format and also show in those answers how you meet Amazon's leadership principals with actual examples. Very much ""tell me about a time"" questions. I studied and was completely ready for the interview. I talked with six or seven people (some in pairs) over the course of two to three hours. People were generally friendly and considerate. Having felt confident in my interviews, I was told three days later that the feedback on me was great and that I would be a great fit for Amazon. However, the job had been offered to someone else a day before my final interview. This seemed really strange to me since I wasn't given the same consideration as the other candidates and essentially my interview could have been cancelled as I had no chance of getting the job at that point. The recruiter went to great pains to say this was standard operating procedure at Amazon - interviewing people when the job no longer available. The recruiter then said he would try to get me an interview with another division of Amazon for a similar role. This also happened fairly quickly - I was told about two other roles and soon was speaking over video to various hiring managers and team members. This interview was less rigorous since I was told ""you already passed the interview process"" and we don't want to put you through that again. After this round of interviews was complete, I got a call from the recruiter saying that the feedback on me was positive, but the role had been offered to someone just one hour before I interviewed with the team and unfortunately no role was available. So again, everyone's time was completely wasted. This was the second time I was fed this story from the recruiter (apparently it's part of their playbook when you are not quite the right color, gender, age or sexuality). The chances that this ""bad timing"" coincidence happening twice in a row seemed rare to me. They promised to keep working with me since I was ""Amazon material"" but I was ghosted soon after. Extremely dishonest recruiters, though they are generally quick to get back to you with disingenuous reasons why they won't hire you. Study for the interview, but understand that even if you ace it, they can disregard all the scores and feedback and say ""oops we already hired someone and just forgot to tell you.""", Tell us about a time you disagreed with a manager?   ,Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I was initially contacted by a sourcer and was asked to provide a lot of information, including salary expectations, location, and interview availability. I provided everything and heard nothing for 3 days. I was then contacted by a coordinator who said she was working on my interview schedule and it could be scheduled with only 48 hours notice. On Sunday, I received confirmation for a Monday interview, that was outside of the times I provided, so I had to rearrange my schedule. When I tried to confirm with the coordinator on Monday, I never received a response. I was only told the first name of the person I would be interviewing with, so for all I knew, it was a recruiter. It turns out that it was the direct hiring manager. Amazon has a...unique way of interviewing, that frankly, is condescending and juvenile. I can’t imagine that the interviewer walked away knowing anything about my ability to do the job with the questions asked. He kept referring to the information I was giving to him as data. He said they don’t hire anyone unless they are better than 50% of the people already working in that role. You simply would never be able to know that. Some people interview well, and suck in real life. Some people don’t interview well, but are some of the smartest, hardest working, innovative people you will ever meet. Needless to say, I was turned off by this particular team on the whole and removed myself (with a very nice email) from consideration, to which I never received a response. My advice to amazon is to not be so stringent with the interview process. Treat people has human beings and listen to their stories, have a conversation.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online and then heard back from a recruiter. I was setup to have a phone interview with hiring managers for two roles. I moved forward with only one role where the hiring manager was very friendly and nice to speak with. My main purpose to get the role was not the role itself (very focused only on one area of Finance) but to work for Amazon. Couple weeks later, I spent a whole day virtually interviewing (due to COVID) with a loop panel interview. Out of the five people, three were directors which gave no introduction to their background and jumped right to asking questions in a demanding way. The interview was very much focused on representing their leadership principles. For someone having solid experience working for multiple fortune 500 companies in FP&A, this process was very robotic/brainwashed like. All my experiences I shared related directly to the role so I am not sure they are focused on the right areas when interviewing. I can only imagine how many experienced/smart finance candidates have been rejected since they do not know how to bootlick and obey the LPs.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"For those of you considering interviewing with AMAZON tread lightly. From the get go they will make you believe you are the chosen one as far as candidates go but don’t “put the horse before the carriage “ Because the process is long and cumbersome . As well they ask you about your salary , and tell you about all the exclusive signing bonuses that come with the job as if you were already being offered a position only to get your hopes up ; don’t fall for it. In my opinion that topic should only be discussed with a candidate when it’s a for sure thing. From start to finish it was 6 weeks of availability nightmares and back and forth with recruiting. Whether or not it was the truth I was told the position needed to be filled immediately as the intended start date had passed several days before I actually got the first call. First part is scheduling availability for a 15 min phone call with recruiting to determine if you are a good fit to go to a hiring team member. As long as you know the job description you are applying for you should pass this portion with flying colors. For the second round woth the hiring manager it’s all about one or two leadership principles and maybe a functional component of the job requirements however no technical assessments here just conversation albeit if you just talk about what’s highlighted in interview questions below you will pass this area easily too. Don’t get ahead of yourself though because there’s still a long way to go. After scheduling two weeks of your availability they will then set you with a 6 hour POD virtual onsite interview with members of the hiring team (SIDE NOTE: None of the 6 people interviewing me had more than 4 years experience with company) . For a POD interview they need at least 3 candidates but it’s likely 1000’s applied so know your stuff. For the onsite virtual you will more than likely have to participate in a technical round so if you don’t know SQL,Python , Excel don’t kid yourself and bow out accordingly as to not waste anyone’s time. They will try and stump you and see how you can handle it or see if you tell them you don’t know. Last part of the interview will be the actual hiring manager and mainly this is all leadership principles and simple conversation. Once they are done they tell you you will hear back within 2-5 business days for me it was 7, but a lot of different factors go into that and when they can schedule a debrief . Now on to the debrief portion .. all of the onsite interviewers will individually evaluate you and then come together to talk about it. They will then do a vote , luckily the hiring manager has the ability to swing the vote to overrule any decisions. There is 4 major focus areas , 4 must be great , 1 must be good , the other can be taught , and of course leadership is always factored in too. Now on to the result , ultimately I was denied a position because of the functional component of the interview. I was assessed on writing a few lines of code for SQL and basic questions for Excel exercise. I am advanced in excel more so than SQL and the excel and SQL parts were all pretty elementary beginner level knowledge at that. I was asked to write code for several different scenarios to which I aced without hesitation which leads me to my follow up. When I asked for feedback on how I can improve myself I was told AMAZON does not provide feedback because that is all kept internal for the hiring team. Which with my current employer and even many other places they always welcome giving feedback. Nonetheless recruiter did tell me it possibly was SQL if they had to guess to which I aced in all accords without hesitation so that answer from them was obviously a punt. If you made it this far into the review I thank you and leave you with this .. you can have all the knowledge in the world , however the process is cumbersome, disheartening , and involves to many people for a company of this magnitude so be weary."," All leadership principles based on those STAR METHOD, tel me about time when ..

In the phone interview the person who was interviewing me asked me to describe my background where I told him I had a track record of leading teams to solve deep technical problems, which is what I think I was going to do for them. He told me that I may have misunderstood the job responsibilities and gave me a list of things which almost exactly overlapped with what I have already told him. He then proceeded to ask me Amazon's famous behavioral questions but with a lot more depth than I have prepared for. I have prepared a large number of shallow examples (>100), but he got stuck going deeper and deeper based on the first example that I gave him. We spent 10 minutes on what probably was a not so appropriate example for what he was looking for. During the questioning he paid extra attention on not leading me to answers, which resulted in a guessing-game: ""Umm is this kind of experience you a are looking for?"" ""No"". ""Is it this one?"" ""No""...etc. Being a manager myself, I appreciated his effort to not lead me, but he ended up only probing %5 of my relevant experience in the 45 minutes he spent with me, and that %5 was probably not the good part. I thought to myself he could have at least given up on ""not leading"" approach after it failed, and ask me directly: ""do you have experience on such and such?"" and learn more more about me rather than playing the guessing game..

That was hard for me as I sell via a team structure and it's truly a we if...well...we will or lose. Also had to complete a writing sample which I had some fun with. Probably one of the reasons they didn't move me along in the process. I don't tend to color inside the lines so probably not a good Amazonian fit as you really have to buy into the culture of Jeff. Works for some but definitely not for all. Recruiters were ok. Mostly one way with not a lot of luck answering my questions. When rejection came, it was pretty cold and disinterested in delivery. Even though they came to me, they offered no feedback. Just no thanks...click. So my advice to anyone interviewing with Amazon is to take a look at the time investment versus the rewards before engaging with them. Looking back, I would have still gone through the process even knowing the outcome if for nothing else than the experience."," All the questions where in the ""tell me about a time when..."" milieu.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"For three successive years, I got email from corporate recruiters asking me to apply for various senior software development management positions. I finally responded. The initial phone screening went very well, and I was scheduled to speak to a manager (but not the hiring manager) in some three weeks time. The interview did not go well at all. It was partly, perhaps mostly, my fault. The interviewer began with the question, ""Have you ever been a manager before?"" This caught me by surprise. I've been a manager of software development, at two top-tier companies, for more than twenty years. It's on my resume. Thinking back, I suppose I should have said ""Yes"" and then closed my mouth and waited for the next question on the interviewers list. Instead, I gave details (typically 15+ direct reports, including PhD-level individual contributors and senior managers with their own teams, and I probably talked too much). The next question was, ""How many people have you managed before?"" I reiterated what I had said. After a few more questions about my management experience, the next question was something like, ""Have you ever had a problem where you have had a team member who needed to be disciplined or fired?"" Thinking now, I suppose I should have said ""No"" and closed my mouth. But instead I went on at great length about how my hiring process (all team members meet individually with the candidate; the candidate gives a formal presentation to the group on a relevant topic) and my engagement with the staff has precluded the need for any of this. The next question asked me to describe some important technical projects, and how I dealt with lateral managers, upper managers, customers, etc. I went on and on. I am now thinking that brevity is the soul of wit. (Mistake #1, repeated several times here.) The succeeding questions were exceedingly repetitive, and I had no indication that the interviewer understood anything I was saying. At one point (and this is where it really got to be my fault) I said, ""Sir, you are beginning to try my patience."" (Mistake #2.) Fortunately, the allotted time was soon over. I immediately called the recruiter and requested another interviewer. (Mistake #3.) Instead, the recruiter said she would call me in a few days. After her review with the interviewer and other team members, the recruitment team decided not to proceed with me. At this point, nothing of a technical or actual management nature had been discussed. The interview was three years in the offing, yet botched by a personality clash in a few minutes. The recruiter later told me that she would do better in the future at preparing potential hires for their interviews. I suggested these two bits of advice for potential recruits: (1) Don't expect the interviewer to have even looked at your resume. (2) Don't expect the interviewer to pay attention to anything you say. (That was Mistake #4.)",,Amazon

Then we went up to another station one by one for something mostly on their side to be processed. 10 minute oral drug test (quest labs) was next. 2 days later, I had an offer letter with a start date 2 weeks from the date of my ""interview"". 2 more days later, I had an updated start date of one week post interview.", No questions were asked.   ,Amazon

Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"The initial recruiter conversation and tech screening conversations went very well. However, that is were the positive experience ended. I was juggled between 4 different recruiters during the rest of the process. Had numerous scheduled interviews cancel, delay or people not attend session times. Finally was called back and was asked to attend an onsite interview in Seattle with one weeks notice. Was able to make myself available to attend in person, as I was told it would be better to be in person for the ""AWS Experience."" Was informed that I would be having 5 interviews with people onsite and then a panel presentation at the end of the day. To my disbelief 3 out of the 5 interviews decided to not be onsite and preferred remote meetings due to customer obligations - since those that didn't attend where in Europe I would have to believe that there never was an intention of showing up onsite. This seemed like a giant waste of my time and AWS dollars having me fly to SEA to sit ALONE in an interview room performing video interviews. Almost felt like a test with the staff not showing up. There were connectivity issues during the interviews which made the insane AWS questioning even harder to understand. It seemed that the team I was meeting with was ill prepared and I had the schedule of people shuffled around last minute. My ""panel"" presentation was to ONE PERSON, the rest were WITHOUT video and watching the presentation from the AWS staff members shared laptop - IT WAS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. There also was some serious miscommunication of role expectations: like not mentioning heavy international travel during the screening process. It seemed very much like an interrogation and not a professional interview. I know AWS practices there bias neutral interview processing but it seems rather aggressive and cold. Having been thru interviews and worked at places like Dell, EMC and RedHat the whole AWS experience was off-putting. Seems like AWS is more concerned about fitting into some desired mold versus finding someone with matching technical expertise that would benefit the team.",,Amazon

No Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied for the Area Manager position online in late 2019 but before the holidays. After applying I was sent an email with a link to an assessment. The assessment test was fairly easy and consisted of a math question relating to process flow. I finished my assessment and submitted it. I was emailed from amazon HR in early January 2020 asking to set up a final interview and was given a few different dates and times when I could schedule it. I chose my day and time and emailed them back to confirm I had received the email and scheduled my final interview.

They have a five day rule for online interviews where they are supposed to let you know within five days of an offer and it hasn't been nearly that long since my interview yet. The interviews were pretty laid back and I didn't find their questions to be very hard... Mostly they are just looking at what your experiences have been and how you solve problems. I can honestly say that I enjoyed the interviews because my interviewers were really friendly and upbeat.

Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I went through the Amazon process 3 times. It starts with a Recruiter interview on the phone, followed by a second phone interview with a manager. Then you might make it to ""the loop"", where you spend 5 hours in back to back interviews. They used to then make you do a one hour presentation, but now they have you write a paper instead. In my first go round, I made it to the loop, and spent about 40 hours memorizing the leadership principles along with examples of how they've played out in my career, watching Jassy's keynote, and preparing my presentation. On Tuesday I got a call from the recruiter confirming my Thursday loop, which I'd taken the day off to do. On Wednesday I got an email saying they had another candidate who was further along in the process, so they made him an offer and I didn't need to come in. I wasted a full week preparing. A year later I got a call from another recruiter who scheduled me for a call with a manager. The manager was supposed to phone me at 9am, but didn't call until 9:20 and said he had a 'hard stop' at 9:30. I don't think he heard a word I said, and I didn't make it past that call. Round 3 was about 8 months later, and I was referred by an Amazon employee. I got through the phone interviews and was scheduled for the loop once again. I was told to (again) memorize the leadership principles, take notes on Jassy's 3 hour keynote and be prepared to be quizzed about it, write a paper, and study a stack of white papers. It was a good 50 to 60 hours of prep, so I declined to proceed any further. Their interview and hiring process is just too grueling.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I had an initial phone screen with HR and a first round phone interview with a Product Manager. The phone screen was very pleasant, the first round not so much. To preface, I have had many interviews where I did not get the job but felt that the process was positive and a great learning experience, so this is not coming from a place of bitterness. I have a decent job at the moment and am just looking around at some bigger names in the tech industry to make an upward move. The questions were nothing out of the ordinary, although the stressing of the STAR method and Amazon’s “unique” approach to interviewing (tell me about a time, give me an example when, yadda, yadda) prior to the interview can drive up your anxiety and make you unnecessarily overthink the whole thing. The main issue was related to the condescending tone of the follow up questions to my responses, implying that I provided useless/inaccurate data to teams I’ve supported, handled deadlines that were not truly ""tight"", handled requests that were not truly ""difficult"", did not truly go “above and beyond” for a customer. At one point, after discussing a project in which I provided a team member with data for a client meeting, it was implied that I gave out confidential information, which was completely false. I felt that I spend the entire time on defense and the interviewer definitely was a bit on the arrogant side, making lots of false assumptions. The intelligence and knowledge on the analytical side was definitely there while the emotional intelligence seemed to be lacking. Regardless, I definitely get why a lot of follow up questions are necessary as many candidates are not truthful, fluff their experience, and already have their hero stories ready to go. You want to see how a candidate thinks on their feet and ensure they can back up everything they are saying. However, when it feels like the interviewer is spending the entire time trying to generate an “ah-ha” moment, catch you in a lie, and delegitimize your experience, there is definitely an issue. I would suggest to any interviewer that if you ask follow up questions and are unsatisfied by a candidate’s response, note that their response for that particular question (or all of them) did not fit what you were looking for and keep it moving. Assume the fit is just not there rather than having someone talk in circles and unable to properly answer the remaining questions. Although this is a single individual in a global leader in the tech industry, I have to say I expected a bit better.",,Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied online and also had an internal referral from an Amazon employee.

On the day of the interview, the hiring manager sent me a text message 5 minutes prior to the scheduled interview time to ask to delay the interview to later that evening (this should have been my first red flag). The hiring manager did not follow up with me that same day to reschedule and I had to text him back 4 hours later, only then did he offer an alternate time later that evening. Finally when he called later that evening, he advised that the role was not a Sr. Manager role but an individual contributor role, and that there was not a Sr. Manager role available. I questioned him as to why Amazon would post a job description for a Sr. Manager role when it was not available and he began to nervously talk in circles stating that Amazon posts ""generic"" job descriptions ( his exact words) and then the recruiter will match the candidates to the actual available positions. I advised him this was very mis-leading and false advertising. Since this job was located in Seattle, and I am located on the east coast, I would not be interested in relocating across the country for an individual contributor role. I was only interested in relocating for a Sr. Manager role which I was highly qualified for and have all the qualifications in the posted job description. I applied to a Sr. Manager role, the only job I have ever applied for at Amazon, and I have an email confirmation showing the job description and job ID for a Sr. Manager role which I applied for. I also had an internal referral from a current Amazon employee for this job ID and he advised me that this was indeed a Sr. Mgr. role in their internal system. I find it very strange that 2 days after I applied and when the hiring manager called that this advertised job was not available as he was the Sr. Manager and he was hiring for an individual contributor role on his team. I have never experienced such mis-leading, false advertising in the hiring process for any company. I followed up with the recruiter for an explanation but the recruiter did not reply.

No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Submitted resume online, recruiter contacted me a week or so afterwards. Recruiter set up a phone interview, which consisted of two behavioral questions and a straight forward math flow problem. Following the phone screen, Amazon invited me to an on-site interview. During the on-site interview, I interviewed with 4 employees, one being the HR manager who failed to introduce himself before firing off 5-8 straight behavioral questions. Of the 5-8 questions, he may have asked 2 follow up questions which to me shows a lack of analytical thinking and an inability to truly assess the talent of the interviewee. Another interviewer tried to modify the math problem I'd previously done but ended up miscalculating the problem himself and I had to politely correct him. A third interviewer came off as a very nice person, but I could tell she had no clue what I was talking about once I started talking specifics about my tech background. Amazon relies heavily on it's leadership principles (in theory) and pretends to only want ""the best."" I've interviewed and hired a couple hundred people throughout my career and it was very obvious to me that the interviewers were far from exceptional. They are likely decent workers, but not the rock stars Amazon claims to want. I'm assuming most of the true genius is on the tech side and the manufacturing leadership, that pretends to be technical are no better than the manufacturing leadership at any of the top 500 companies globally.

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through the Amazon website without knowing anyone at the company. The recruiter contacted me and asked some questions about my background and willingness to reloacte. The recruiter called back the next day to schedule a phone interview. The phone interview included mostly technical questions to make sure that I didn't lie on my resume. There were a few behavioral questions that I assumed were to make sure I wasn't crazy. A few days later, the recruiter called to say that they wanted to schedule an onsite interview and wanted me to submit some writing examples. I sent in some company conceptual docs and API docs that had been through editing with someone else, and I indicated that. I provided a couple of example posts on my blog that were entirely mine with no editor. Of course, I understood that they would look at my website, my blog posts, my LinkedIn profile and any only online presence they could find. A few weeks later, I went to Seattle for the onsite interview. The company paid for the flight and hotel for 2 nights. They did allow me to fly home a day later, and I paid for the extra night in the hotel. They reimbursed for taxi or rideshare and food costs. The day of the interview, I was there for 7 hours. I interviewed with 6 people: my future manager, his manager, 2 writers, a pair of editors, and a developer. The recruiter had given me some info about the process. I had a list of all of the people's first names and their role at AWS. The recruiter told me to completely understand the Amazon Leadership Principals, and told me to expect behavioral questions that I should answer in the STAR format. I did my homework and had prepared a STAR-format story to demonstrate each leadership principal. I stayed in a conference room and the interviewers came and went. I had 3 one-hour interviews with water and bathroom breaks. Then someone escorted me to the lunch of my choice. My lunch companion told me that I could rest my brain for an hour. They were not evaluating me and could not contribute to the hiring decision. They were there to give me a break and let me ask any questions about the area or what it was like to work for AWS. After lunch I had three more interviews and then was escorted out of the building. I was mentally exhausted and ordered food delivery to my hotel.

I had 1 phone interview set up with the Director, but at the last moment he could not make it so I had a rushed, unprepared interview with someone else on the team. Phone interview was mostly regular data warehousing concepts and SQL questions (types of joins, paritioning, etc). I did well enough in this conversation to make it to the on-site interview. The radical differences in expectations, questions and answers to my questions about the role/team between the 5 interviewers made me think that they were not on the same page about this role. The Data Engineer said that BI Engineers just build views that the users ask for; but then he quizzed me on data engineering concepts for the rest of the hour. At least in my interview with the BI Engineer who would be my peer, I actually wrote SQL for the first time in this process (on a worksheet they had printed out for me, during the last interview of the day in the final round on-site). But the BI Engineer said that they basically do everything and data engineering would only get involved in really complex situations; he then proceeded to also give me a vocab quiz on advanced data modeling and big data performance topics. Mind you, the job description only required ""Experience with MS Excel, Access and SQL/SAS""... ""MBA preferred""...

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied for a job on the AWS side of Amazon. I was well-warned about the questions I would be asked and was prepared by a recruiter. No concerns there. I found the questions fair but I was also very glad I prepared as they suggested, aligning my work experience to Amazon's 14 leadership principles. I have a meaningful comment, however, and here it is: I found out too late that Amazon really only allows you to apply for 1 job within a 3 month period. So...make sure you are applying for the exact job you want or you will not get a second chance - at least not in a reasonable time frame. This ""rule"" bit me hard. I had a fantastic interview and they even asked me to come back after the interview was over to chat for another 30 minutes BUT ... that particular job wasn't a good fit for me. I don't know how we got to the face to face interview without either me or them realizing this....but we did. So, I missed out on applying for a job I am absolutely perfect for. I had been referred by an employee, had 2 phone interviews, and an 8 hour face to face interview all for a job that wasn't an ideal fit. I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to apply again for 3 months until after I had interviewed and the job didn't work out. I thought others could easily avoid the same thing. Their interview process is good and fair, but it isn't worthy of the cult-like enthusiasm the employees seem to have for it. On one hand they say...""you are either an Amazonian or you aren't"" and the interview process is meant to tease that out but on the other hand, the rigidity of their system disallows them to consider someone who IS the right kind of person for another role within the company that may fit both you and their company better. Wholly inconsistent. I will also add that they did not follow up with me well after the interview or for the 2 other jobs I applied for before realizing I was being black-balled for having applied for a job within the last 3 months. Best of luck to others!","They ask many, many behavioral and situational questions such as...""Can you describe a situation where you were put in XXXX position and you had to make a quick decision without the advantage of data or info.

I had the algorithm coded as a function within 5-10 minutes. My interviewer, despite conceding that my implementation was a correct interpretation of the suggested algorithm, went on to point out certain redundancies in my code with unnecessary if-blocks. On agreeing with him and getting rid of them, he was satisfied. However, by this time, I was aware that the interview had gone overtime and he just asked me if I had any questions for him.

A room with video for half of the interviews and the others were in person. They all were frantically typing what you say instead of looking you in the eye and honestly caring about you as a person. The questions were ridiculous and honestly- they just want to test you with manipulating questions to see how “loyal” you are. It’s a company of soldiers, not of individuals who contribute meaningfully. Half way through the day, I just shut off and was probably overly candid with my answers by that point.

No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Initial recruiter chat and scheduling by the interview coordinator, well oiled and impersonal, prompt feedback (status only, no details), had applied through an employee referral. Had two phone interviews, did not get to the onsite stage. First phone interview of an hour had one behavioral question and technical questions for the remaining time. The second phone interview, also an hour long, was purely behavioral questions, guess the followup tries to plug areas which the former did not cover. Interviewers prepare and tailor questions based on your resume and what the job area entails (and of course if any area the previous interviewer missed or did not cover well). The interview focus is on the Amazon leadership principles and the STAR format. The interviewers seem to take notes like a court recorder. The behavioral questions overwhelmingly constitute of 'tell me of a time or situation when' (I have covered the questions later in this review). If you did not resolve a situation in a way that falls in the framework of the leadership principles regardless of whether you actually could, I imagine its a negative and two 'escalations' for resolutions by me (the interviewer gently guided them to be portrayed like that) perhaps sealed it for me notwithstanding that for one situation I was a contractor and I had no authority to drive a resolution with the internal company stake holders and I had to pass it on to my supervisor and in the second instance it was a director peer who was just plan rigid and the SVP had to intervene. Wish there were cliff notes for the behavioral part (cracking the coding interview was not much help here). The interviewers were personable, cordial and professional and respected my career progression and achievements, they did not stomp all over me as you read in some other reviews. I believe I coasted through the first interview, though I could have dwelt deeper on some of the questions. When I asked the second interviewer about the next stage, they kinda inadvertently gave it away by saying something like, 'if they are so inclined, there will be an onsite, the coordinator is supposed to get back to you in a day or two, do not hesitate to follow up with them'.",,Amazon

After the incredible amount of time I invested in the process, I was told “we are going in a different direction”. I took two pto days for their whim. Pretty disappointed in what I consider lousy treatment of a candidate...but amazon has a reputation for treating their employees horribly, so not so surprising. It has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I was a loyal customer for 15 years. Also, their compensation for a Corp job is capped base pay that is below market (“RSUs make up for it!”), no bonus, and heavily weighted on the RSUs from your initial hire grant. So, they are not paying you out of their operating budget but rely on the stock appreciating. Brilliant on one hand, as it costs them nothing, but the right thing to do? In their minds, Stock appreciation makes up for not giving merit, bonus or paying a competitive base salary.

So know the amazon principals and be able to demonstrate how you follow them in your daily life, cause that's what Jeff does. Don't worry about education or if you even know what a red black tree algorithm is - just make sure you make a really good diagram, because your resume is really worthless here. It's all about if you copied the most complex amazon diagram you could find on google - not actual real world customer architectures you may have built and actually implemented. Also they try to groom you for the reduction in benefits- you might sign up for their lunch and they will bring you a pb&j sandwich. Then they'll proceed to tell you how if it's on the company dime they all compete with each other to see who had the cheapest meal or got the cheapest hotel. Cause they are all ""stock holders"" at amazon and want that stock price to go up up and away. So make sure you add a little extra into your salary requirements for the motel 6's you'll stay at and the subway sandwiches you'll probably be sharing.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I was contacted via email by a sourcing recruiter who said she'd like to schedule a phone interview. A day or so later the interview was scheduled by a recruiting coordinator. The day of the interview, the coordinator reached out to let me know that the original recruiter was no longer going to make the interview and provided the information of the person who was interviewing in her place. This recruiter started the call like I imagine he always does, pulling up my resume, not knowing the role he was considering me for until he consulted his system. I have 10 years of recruiting experience for a large corporation, and I'm open to opportunities that will offer me more exposure to new candidate profiles and career growth. I explained that at my current company I am not responsible for actively sourcing passive candidates, meaning I do not regularly build Boolean searches for individuals - we have sourcers for that - but that this was an area I'd like to gain a little more experience with. After being completely transparent about this, he continued to probe on my sourcing skills. He then asked me ""why Amazon?"" which as a recruiter, I find that to be a very lame question. Why Amazon? Well, for starters, it's Amazon. But I'll go ahead and list the plethora of reasons why I think it would be a great move for me. So, between the sourcing and my answer to his Why Amazon question, I didn't feel that we were jibing with one another. The other thing was that our interview was confirmed as 45 minutes. He spoke for probably 20 of those minutes, not really seeming interested in what I could bring to the conversation, which was frustrating considering it was an interview. At the 30 minute mark, he let me know that he was finished, and I was unclear about when the actual interview was set to end. Was he done now? When I asked if we had 45 minutes, he said that I could bring my questions as this was time set aside...it was just weird and didn't flow...almost like he hoped it would end early. I asked five or six questions about the role, metrics, etc, which he responded to but seemed closed off. I could feel that he wasn't interested in moving forward, despite wrapping the call by saying ""someone from the team will be in touch with next steps."" ""Next steps"" was code for a generic email from the coordinator letting me know they were not moving forward. As a recruiter, I could feel the bad vibe through the phone because I recognized some of myself in his process, which is prompting me to change it as he came across as very impersonal despite being ""customer obsessed.""",,Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I can’t speak lowly enough about this interview process. What probably started out as a good idea has been so distorted and twisted that it results in an interview experience that is worse than most root canal procedures. First, the process itself – a phone screening by recruiting, a phone interview with the hiring manager, a written essay about how you exhibited one of their “14 Leadership Principles”, and finally the all-day in-person interview loop. Everything was going well until that last part. Hoo boy... where to begin? Amazon workers have clearly been indoctrinated into some very unusual and horrendous interview techniques. First, they each are assigned one of the “14 Leadership Principles” and they don’t veer from that topic. Second, apparently they each need to have oodles of information about each candidate for some lengthy write-up after they’re done with you that they must defend to others, so they each explain how they’re going to be “quickly typing” the entire session but that they’re “really listening! Really!”. As if this absolves them of the fact that it’s extremely rude and ineffective when interviewing a potential worker. They each made very little eye contact, often cut off my responses, and seemed distracted by many things on their laptops. To make matters worse, I was interviewed by one person, a “bar raiser”, who has god-like powers over your interview process, doesn’t even work on the team, is easy to spot (they’re the rudest of them all), and asks no questions about your ability to actually do your job. In fact, that’s the overarching theme – since they all have to strictly stay within bounds of the “14 Leadership Principles” (which are suspect to say the least with not one of them being ‘collaboration’, and one is actually ‘Is always right’! I kid you not – look it up). So nobody – not one person – actually asked me anything about how I would do my job. I got so numb by the end of it that I was just drolly repeating my stories, hoping to just get out of there with some semblance of my sanity left. They all share their opinions of you in advance with each other instead of waiting until the end, and they even share these opinions real time while you’re sitting there (did I mention how rude and humiliating this entire process is??), so by the time the last person interviewed me, he actually asked to offer me advice on my resume! I told him, sure, why not, and his advice was absolutely idiotic. The same resume I used to get their attention also worked at a place that I’m so grateful to be working now with a normal interview process.

I am sure the hiring manager is surely a terrific gentleman and an awesome employee but sadly, he was completely disengaged, disconnected, uninterested and unwilling to actually interview someone in order to hire and add a new (International) team member to the Alexa family. Before even starting the interview he told me to 'avoid being generic' in my answers but why would he assume I am going to be generic? In my opinion the hiring process was already being handled in an arrogant, presumptuous, condescending and intimidating way, I already knew there was no way I would get the job.

After each of my answers he would reply with a very bored ""Okay"" instead of commenting something pertinent to my actual answers. It seemed he was literally forced to interview me, perhaps someone else higher than him in the company told him he had to do it. It was so obvious the last thing he wanted to do was to interview me. Or maybe he had an internal co-worker or a friend who really wanted to get the job. He seemed very closed and absent minded and not welcoming and excited at all.

The interviewer and hiring manager actually seemed to not care at all about the fact that I am bilingual and that I am from a different country and truly gave me the impression that to him, it was completely irrelevant to the position and the role. He was very unimpressed with any experience of mine that was ""International"" which doesn't make any sense because Amazon is an International Corporation. His answers to my questions about the role didn't make any sense and he seemed very bothered by the fact that I actually had questions about the role and he also made me repeat the questions because he wasn't paying attention.

A six-hour, on-campus interview cycle with seven people (one via video conference). Some of the people interviewing me were just people that the EA position interacts with, but doesn't support. The questions were all very similar, and I was well-prepared thanks to the second HR person I spoke with who gave me a ton of information about Amazon and Amazon's leadership principles. What I should have done was research job reviews on Glassdoor. All of the questions boiled down to two repetitive themes: What won't you do for Amazon?

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The interview was very clear-cut and transparent throughout the entire process. The recruiters were very knowledgeable and professional - always making themselves available for phone discussions and responding fairly quickly to email inquiries. The same with the hiring manager - even if I sent a question at midnight - he responded to my inquiry within a half-hour. I had a phone screen in mid Sept 2017 and then an onsite in December-end 2017. The process took 4 months because I think my team was a team in-the-making; I think most interviews can be wrapped up anywhere from a few weeks to 2 months. The phone screen consisted of general technical questions such as what do you like about AWS product XYZ and where do you think it can be improved. Why would you choose one product over another, what are some of the biggest flaws that you see in architectures these days, etc. as well as some general interview questions like: Why AWS? The onsite interview was a bit grueling with 6 people interviewing me and then my giving an architecture presentation to a panel group. The interview, however, focused entirely on the role for which I was interviewing, the associated skillset, and the Amazon leadership principles. Note: they don't ask you choppy questions like: ""Give me an example of when you have demonstrated Leadership principle 10"". They ask about the leadership principles in indirect ways. They were not interested much in my past projects or coding exercises (there were some coding questions) - they have their own subtle, investigative ways of determining intelligence, knowledge, passion, judgement, and potential. I thought the Big Data Specialty and Solutions Architect Professional certifications as well as reading a ton of whitepapers helped me in preparing (Note: don't just pass the exams - actually master the material). Also, know the STAR method for sharing anecdotes - very important, and be honest in your stories - they can smell truth holes like a shark smells blood in water! The architecture presentation was a bit nerve-racking in that I didn't know what they were looking for exactly or what I was being judged on - they simply said take 45 minutes to present a project architecture from your past that you are proud of and show us how it could be implemented in AWS if it isn't already.

The guy who interviewed me was really nice, he considered my preference (backend) and asked another team to interview me for an SDE position. The guy who interviewed my for the SDE position was not a good interviewer at all. He did not make me feel comfortable, had an extremely unreasonable question for a phone screen and went on mute completely and told me to code, was not responding to me at all during this time. It felt like he already had already made his decision to select another candidate. He had two questions planned for me to complete in around 45 mins. The first question was : given a t9 keyboard( the ones on the old mobile phones) , as the user goes on typing digits (eg: 228), the algorithm should suggest VALID ENGLISH words. I suggested a correct approach, using tries. He wanted the entire code for this.Now, this is something that cannot be coded within half an hour. and he wanted to ask one more design question apart from this. I got a reject within 3 days. It was frustrating because I had got the strategy right, but I guess they want machines who can vomit out memorized code and not creative thinkers. Also, with Amazon, it completely depends on your interviewer. Some are nice, some are plain jerks and they have no justification for why they rejected you.

Now I need to schedule my New Hire Event (not orientation) they held this at a hotel in the city for about a week and you picked the day and they had times starting about 8am and every hour until 4pm.

You NEED to bring proper ID to this event (U.S. Passport, Photo ID AND Social Security Card or Driver's License AND U.S. Birth Certificate, etc) The event was pretty casual. You get there and check in and you're given a paper with your ID and other info and a paper with all the available shift schedules. The event started with an area manager guy going over all the basic stuff, watched a video on how the wearhouse operated, etc. Very informational stuff. Guy was super nice and easy going. That lasted about 30 min or so then we all went to the another room to do the drug test. That lasted about 30 min. Was a simple swab test. After that you leave yet room and check in with a rep to choose your shift preference then you're led into a final room where you give them your ID's and after they check off all your paperwork your badge photo is taken and that was it. They told us that next we would get an email stating if we passed out failed the background check and drug test. If you passed then you'd be scheduled a Virtual New Hire Orientation.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online for a position in Seattle, WA. An Amazon recruiter contacted me and told me that she was going to submit me to the hiring manager. A week later I received an invite for a telephone interview asking for my best times to receive a 1-hour call. Once I submitted that information I received another email stating that I had an interview appointment with guy1 on a specific date and time. One day before the interview I received an email that stated that guy1 couldn't make it and he would be replaced by another person (guy2). During the call guy 2 divulged that he was not a part of the team that I had applied for and was in a pool of interviewers and lived in New York City. I waited 1 1/2 weeks after the interview and didn't hear a single word back and then I emailed the recruiter to ask if I was eliminated from the selection process. She called me about three hours later and said that they didn't feel that I was a good fit for the role but they had this other role in the same group that she wanted me to consider. I told her ok in the call and then she started talking about flying me to Seattle. I thought this was a bit hasty because I had not even spoke with the hiring manager and I am getting a face to face interview. I live in Dallas, TX and they flew me to Seattle, paid for my hotel, and I was there with bells on to interview for this job. It was a very long day with seven one hour interviews. They saved the hiring manager for the second to the last interview. I was exhausted by then and was loosing my voice but keep my composure to give them a great interview. Afterwards, I flew back to Dallas and the recruiter emailed me straight away to inform me I was not selected. In reflection, it seemed very unfair. They were too quick to pull the trigger for a face to face interview of me for a role where I was never interviewed by anyone from the team or the hiring manager. Two weeks later I saw another Sr. Program Manager’s position on a website and it was in Austin, TX which is only 200 miles away instead of Seattle, WA. I applied for that position and received a note from the recruiter that said ""Once you have had a face to face interview with Amazon, and you are not selected, you are barred from the selection process for two years” I feel that is the most discriminatory thing that I have ever heard. What if the hiring manager in Austin, TX would have taken the time to get to know me and found that I was better qualified than any of the candidates that had applied?

So you need to be very flexible with your schedule. Because of the reshuffling I only have four sessions during my on-site interview. I imagine there would be more if things worked out according to schedule.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Initial phone screen by recruiter, then subsequent call informing me decision to move forward with Director I would be reporting to. Recruiter coached me of senior level roles at Amazon, expectations and sent to me some really great collateral to prepare including Bezos's history/story and deep culture information. The call went great with the Director, we connected on a lot of levels and shared a lot of similar experience. I was flown up to Seattle for a day of interviews, the interviews were great until the final interview. Surreal. In the prep material, they detail what the final day will be like, and they let you know in advance, the final interview will be conducted by some form of quality assurance person looking out for overall 'fit' in the company - and likely not a part of the actual hiring team. My interview with this person started out just fine, but he informed me there would be some new advisor joining us, she would be in training (or something, he wasn't too sure himself, and said he did not know her). We waited together politely for her for almost 15 minutes, she was late. We made small talk, discussed each others backgrounds a bit, but he wanted to wait for her to begin. Then the most unpleasant and surreal experience happened. The door literally flew open and this explosive energy entered our space. She was very young and aggressively shook my hand quickly - completely ignoring who I thought was the actual interviewer. She took immediate control, and began assaulting me with a barrage of questions. She cut me off mid sentence in ever response, furiously tapping at her laptop not making eye contact. She interrupted the main interviewer every single time he began to speak. She guffawed at several of my responses, at times she even laughed maliciously. I was so flustered I could hardly put thoughts together. I was extremely confused, and kept trying to defer my responses to the person I thought was the actual interviewer to somehow engage him in the conversation. It was the single most unprofessional, humiliating and embarrassing/uncomfortable professional meeting of any kind I've ever had in more than 25 years in the business. I was left feeling like the looser of the world and I had completely wasted everyone's time, despite more than 15 years of professional Product Management at leading companies, building global software teams and in possession of a quality MBA. Occasionally I still think back on the encounter. I wonder if it was planned in advance to gauge my reaction to challenging/conflicting situations - although watching the behavior of the core interviewer, the multitude of colors his face changed during the interview would have required the utmost professional actor with decades of experience. In the end, I'm glad it happened. I had heard all the horror stories of working at Amazon, the sacrifices you make from personal life, and this confirmed at senior levels, I have zero desire to ever interact with anyone like that again. If this is the caliber of talent Amazon seeks for senior executive recruiting, I'm out. Won't ever be applying at Amazon again.","The conversations were diverse and complex. Most of the interviewers wanted to know stories about how I'd overcome obstacles in past challenges, and what I felt my greatest success was.

No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"First, the hiring manager contacted me on LinkedIn. After which I was asked for my resume and then HR setup the technical phone screening. Interviewer showed up about 10 mins late and took about 1 hour for the entire process.",,Amazon
No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I submitted my resume online and was eventually contacted by an Amazon Web Services recruiter. I went through 2 phone interviews, each an hour long, then had to write a 6 page, 10-pt single-spaced paper with executive summary based off a prompt they gave me about the needs of a potential client. I had 7 days to research and write it. This was probably the most difficult part of the interview because the guidance on what they are actually looking for is minimal. I researched several of AWS' 70+ features and chose a handful to write about, hoping they were the right applications for the prompt. After I made it through that round, I had 6 hours of in-person interviews on site in Herndon, VA. A week before my interviews they scheduled a 30 minute phone call with another AWS recruiter who basically coached me on how to be successful in the interview; what they're looking for, how to prepare, etc. That helped me a lot when getting ready. Each interview was one-on-one in a small 'interview room' and 45 minutes long. Generally these interviews were not very warm. You are not left alone the entire day; they don't want you wandering off in the building so you always have a chaperone and interviewers don't leave until the next one arrives. 3 of my 5 interviews were given by remote employees and were supposed to be over video chat but the chat didn't work for any of them so we had to resort to over the phone, and I don't know how that may have affected the interview process since they couldn't read body language and we couldn't talk face to face. Lunch was provided and you ate with an employee who was not interviewing you, so it's nice they don't interview you over lunch. Every person who interviewed me worked in some capacity on the team I would be working on, except one and I am assuming he was the 'bar raiser' because he really pushed me. and his interview was the hardest All questions asked at every interview stage were 'tell me about a time when' or 'give me an example of'- type scenario questions, and then they would ask further in-depth questions about the scenario I described, so you can't really BS your way through. You have to really know and remember details about the experience you are describing because they are going to grill you on it to gauge how you respond to different events. They want to know what you already HAVE done, so come prepared with really good examples you want to share and how they fit with the job description AND the Leadership Principles. The AWS recruiter told me that it's ok to only have a handful of stories and reuse them in different interviews as long as you can apply them to various Leadership Principles (but bear in mind everyone who interviews you does get together after to score you so they'll know all the example scenarios you used). Every question throughout all levels of interviewing were based on the Principles. I studied for my in-person interviews like I would a test, reviewing the Principles and coming up with examples from my work history that exemplified them. Although they told me I would hear either way within a week, I did not hear from them for 3 weeks which I found unusual and kind of unprofessional. I finally emailed the recruiter and asked for confirmation, at which point they finally confirmed I had not gotten the job.", Tell me about a time you disagreed with a co-worker on a project and lost.   ,Amazon

It was an interesting experience overall, but most of my interviewers didn't really know much about the specific job, or even about what instructional design is! I had a couple interviewers ask me to explain what my field is, and they also all declined to look at my portfolio (with one saying that he just wouldn't understand it).

Before I went out to the onsite he gave me his cell number and told me to call with any questions I have. So I called that number 2 days later and left a message and of course nothing back.

Before arriving for the interview that day, I had not spoken to anyone in person, and then during the day I had two short interviews with two people each for about five minutes each. My first of these interviews was with someone whose English was not great which was a significant communication barrier. The rest of the day you are on a computer trying to fill in some methods in a decent sized code base that you need to learn quickly. It seemed that they do not care at all about your personality or anything other than whether you can code at a high volume under intense pressure. It was bizarre and I'm not sure I'd want to work at a place that puts so little value on personability and the infamous 'would you want to work with this person?' question.

No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Amazon's interview is, as advertised, tightly scripted and follows a specific format. Its not crazy-hard in a technical sense; but it is a verbal minefield given the way they train their interviewers to look for key phrases and behaviors. Their focus is on discussing specific examples of what you have done in the past, and on how your answers match up with the Amazon Leadership Principles. Things worth noting: (1) Discussion of future actions/style (i.e. ""things I'd do differently now"") are somewhat ignored, sadly. This can handicap you if you are coming from a previous employment situation where you were held back or unable to execute on something. (2) You are NOT likely to chat with the hiring manager or HR rep at the end of your interview; they don't circle-back like at many companies. So even if you're pressed for time you really need to ask your questions and get clarification from them at the start of your interview day, because you won't have a chance later. (3) Although Amazon trains its interviewers for consistency, they do not all pay the same attention to the role you're interviewing for or your schedule - don't get thrown off if someone in the middle or later stages of your interview describes the job incorrectly or the number of interviewers you have left to see.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I had about 4 phone screens and 1 very long in-person interview in Seattle. I was told to dress business casual, but then I was told to wear jeans and layers due to cool temps in Seattle. Jeans are not business casual, so I am unsure if I was over dressed or under dressed. I've recruited for quite a few technology companies in the past. Some tech companies will rule people out for over dressing. I was told there would be dogs hanging around, because it is a benefit offered by the company. Sadly, I saw none while I was there. The building was dark and kind of dreary, but I was told they had just moved into the building a few weeks before. There were turnstiles that moved very slowly. The onsite is the most difficult part of the process, because it is non-stop behavioral based interview questions being fired off rapid-fire for 45 minutes at a time with 7 different people from 10 am to 2:45 pm. I felt some interviewers approached the process adversarially, but the beginning few seemed nice. I may have been starting to feel hangry/sleepy towards the end though. If you come over from the East Coast, your body will feel like it's three hours later. You end up getting up early and feeling like it's 5:45 instead of the 2:45 by their clocks. They escort you to the restroom and wait outside awkwardly. There is a lunch buddy that will be a little relief from the rapid fire that will buy you lunch. You are so excited that you are barely hungry though. By the end of the day, you question every answer you gave and try to think if the people you were speaking to understood the sometimes complex answer that might be required for ""when you were unable to meet a commitment."" There are lots of great reviews on here about the interview process that helped prepare me. I provided the interview question that made me the most uncomfortable and that kept getting asked by nearly all my interviewers. I would have rated this as a positive experience, except for the long behavioral individual interviews. I would think that Amazon could save a lot of time and maybe end up with a less exhausted candidate had they scheduled a 1-2 hour interview panel instead of 7 different people asking behavioral based interview questions for 45 minute stretches that require a person think of a simple situation to describe to each person asking similar questions. The thing about behavioral based interview questions is that you are not supposed to answer with what you ""would do"" or ""should do."" You are supposed to give a specific example. If you can't think of one, you might be ruled out as being inexperienced. If you give an example that the interviewer doesn't understand fully, you end up sounding defensive or negative as you explain why you didn't take a particular action. It stops being conversational after you answer that same question 3 times for three different people. The company has a commitment to giving a great candidate experience. The experience for me was great up until the exhausting nearly 5 hour interview. They have a commitment to giving an answer within 5 days of the interview. I received mine on the 7th day after 8 pm EST. I have gotten an offer for every position I have interviewed for in the past 10 years other than this one. They won't give any feedback due to ""compliance reasons"" and say that you might have great success if you apply again after 1-3 years. I understand the ""not giving specific feedback"" in a way. They are probably a target for lawsuits. However, during the interview process they tell you that they have a ""certain culture."" The culture I experienced reminded me of ""Mean Girls."" After interviewer #2, the body language was clear when they arrived in the room. They had their arms crossed and the computer blocking them the whole time. Then again, it could have been the fact that I was starving and sleep deprived by the end of the interview. They say the interview questions are based on their leadership principles. However, I really think I could have just gone through all of the typical behavioral based interview questions online rather than studying these principles. Focus on how to answer the behavioral based interviews for negative experiences (conflict, missed commitments, etc) so that you can come up with an example that is easy to explain and has the most positive outcome. I've been recruiting for about 19 years. I currently have a job that pays well and treats me reasonably well. I can say that in some respects, Amazon strives to be a leader in candidate experience. I believe they almost reach it until the last part of the process (the onsite interview). I might try again in a year, but if they are still doing the 5 hour interview, I will ""pass"". That part doesn't feel positive and reminds me of police interrogations that you see on 60 minutes or in ""good cop/bad cop"" tv shows. You will see lots of good tips on Glassdoor about the process and questions.","Give an example of a time when you didn't meet a commitment. Give an example of a time that you didn't meet a commitment to a team member. As I look back I feel like they only asked variations of this question.

The process is so mechanical with the interviewer simply typing every word coming out of your mouth instead of making any eye contact that you feel that it would be better if Amazon hired robots to ask the same questions in a video conference instead of wasting one's time. I met 2 managers and 2 developers. I have never seen such depressing and frustrated software developers at any other firm. While I know that Amazon pays great salary, they looked shabby and very worried and frustrated. On the other hand, the managers were too arrogant and one of them was even yawning at 9 am in the morning while we were talking. I believe Amazon must simply recruit fresh graduates from college instead of wasting their and others' time asking the candidates theoretical algorithm questions that nobody with more than 5+ years of experience remembers. The office looked like a furniture warehouse with dark interiors. The pantry was worst with just a single coffee brewer. While I understand people work to get compensated, such a depressing work environment can seriously affect the morale of any individual. I felt the developers felt trapped as Amazon promises RSUs that get vested only after 4 years and most seem to be just suffering until that time.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,It was a phone interview with one of their corporate functions. This person missed to call me on a scheduled time and pushes the interview. The second time this person calls 10 mins late and seriously there was no apology for the previous incidents. Instead the interviewer was sharing displeasure of holding the call post office hours ( the timing was not my call though). During the whole interview process I could realize the interviewer was thoroughly disengaged. This person would ask me a question but never paid attention to what I was explaining. How?. Because I was again asked a question for which I had already answered. I thought I didn't not answer well but realized it was lack of attention after repeated behavior. At one point I could hear that the interviewer was laughing to someone else's jokes on the other side. I had never had such an insulting experience after being in this industry for so many years., What was the challenging situation you had to handle in recent past and how did you handle it.   ,Amazon

Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Applied through a recruiting firm (Aerotek) and did an in-person interview with them. Also did an in-person interview with the Amazon Operations Center in Tempe. The position I applied and interviewed for was not actually the position I was hired for. Myself and a few others were pulled into a new group for a special project. My direct manager never interviewed me and I was the only person on the team that didn't meet with her. I thought I was pretty lucky though as my recruiter at Aerotek took care of my on-boarding quickly, while others had to deal with pay delays and confusion. However, the ball was dropped somewhere in the middle of my 6 month contract. I was under the impression that any performance feedback would be done by Aerotek, not Amazon, per their agreement with the company. Although when a supervisor was appointed for our team there were bi-monthly 1 on 1's. At no point did my supervisor communicate any problems and neither did the project manager. In fact I was being thanked for my hard work often and was asked to take on extra work and special tasks daily. I also cross-trained for another department, helped write the standard operating procedure for our new team, and did quality checks on the work of my teammates. I was asked to meet a visitor at the front desk one morning, which turned out to be my recruiter from Aerotek who had come to tell me my contract was being terminated. After a few days of being in shock and receiving no follow up, I finally heard from Aerotek and they stated that problems were brought to my attention multiple times and that someone heard me speaking negatively about our project manager. I asked for examples, which they wouldn't provide. As a recruiting agency, this malfunction really falls on them, but the fact that no one from Amazon's HR got involved is also disappointing.

Waited months only to find out things were incomplete or still required on by reaching out repeatedly, No interview. Just an application   ,Amazon
No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"In reply to the email request for a phone interview, I asked for a copy of the job requisition, on 2 occasions, of the position being considered. I received no response. On the call, I asked what position the call was for, and was told they have 10 positions they were looking to fill, so there were multiple, and I could be doing a mix of things. I never got a straight answer. She mentioned 2 times that they were having problems with former airline employees because they were accustomed to structured work places. As a former airline employee, based on that statement alone, I don't know why they wasted my time...She also mentioned a couple of times, things move very fast at Amazon. She also stated they were not bureaucratic in process, and that is why the airline folks are having a hard time, etc.; however, she, herself, seemed very technical, not very engaging at all. Her routine was robotic in nature, a repetitive script, moving quickly through her agenda, with little regard for what I had to say. The compensation package was a bit different than the norm, they use restricted stock offerings instead of bonsues or profit sharing, but when I asked questions or wanted to clarify my understanding, she seemed annoyed. My point is, this is my first exposure to your company and its policies. I am considering multiple opportunities, just as you are considering multiple candidates, and I want information to consider. I'm not a fresh out of school guy looking to build experience. I wanted to make sure I have a clear understanding of the model, to assess whether it's a good fit for me. I can't imagine moving forward into the hiring process, and then finding out later that the compensation package isn't going to work for me. That's just a waste of everybody,s time. The attitude was more like, I should not clarify or inquire about anything, just keep my head down and respond with short, concise, military-like responses and feel privileged to be getting a call. Just keep moving forward through the pipeline, don't ask questions. These tactics must work well on new college grads, with little career experience, just starting out, thinking they'd do anything to work for the company. She seemed very regimented and rigid, and I got the feeling that she already had a predisposition about former airline employees. In my answers to the situational type questions, she seemed uninterested in understanding the thought process and situation that led to the decisions and outcomes along the way, she only wanted one-liners to fill in her paperwork. By the way, wouldn't a regimented routine, with several layers of interviews, fit the very description of bureaucratic in nature? At the end of the phone interview, I was asked if I had any questions about the job. I asked a couple of questions, and quickly learned that this only irritated her, she seemed annoyed every time I asked a question, and the answers were, ""that is confidential at this time since this is a startup unit"", or, ""I can't give you any specifics about the position because there are 10-15 positions that we are considering"". when she asked, ""do you have anymore questions?"" I thought, what's the use? I was then told I would be moving to the next round where I would be contacted shortly to set up a phone interview with a business leader. I also received an email immediately after the call, stating the same. I then received an email the first thing the next morning stating that they have decided to move forward with another candidate for the position, when I responded that I was confused based on our conversation and her email confirmation from the day before, she replied, things move fast at Amazon, and they decided to move forward with a candidate that was already previously in the pipeline. What? They moved forward on 10-15 open positions? It was like a month after applying that they called me. I didn't even remember the nature of the job posting...but they moved forward filling 15 positions overnight? Maybe other recruiters work differently, but this one was not open or transparent about the job, and in the end, there were contradictions to a lot of what she said and did. I can't help to wonder how many employees they burn through, or how many are on Prozac, as the reviews indicate there is no work-life balance. Sounds great for a young single person with a dog. She did mention that you could bring your dog to work..."," Give a time when you made a decision without having all of the information available, and resulted in a negative outcome, what was the situation and outcome, and what did you do to recover?   ",Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"You have to have a HUGE amount of patience for this company. I have been applying on line at Amazon for a year, then a college of mine that works for Amazon recommended me for a few positions and I finally got called. I don't think I would have even received a call if not for him recommitting me. I waited over 2 MONTHS for the actual in person interview from the initial phone screening. I was emailed initially an offer to have a phone interview with a recruiter, the next day she called then told me she was going to keep me in mind when an EA position opened and to NOT interview with any other Amazon positions while I went through the process as it was in bad taste. I waited another week and got an email from a separate recruiter asking for another phone interview. I emailed her back telling her I was in the process of interviewing for an EA position and I was told that it is in bad taste to interview multiple positions. She informed me she was another recruiter for the team. There was a total of 4 phone screening interviews before I landed the in person interview. I then had to do a personality test and basic computer skill test that was emailed to me, simple enough. I got a call the following day and I was told that initially I had been selected for an in person interview, then apparently they promoted an Amazon employee. I was disappointed, but I was informed by the recruiter that she had 2 other positions she wanted to present me for. I was called a week later and told the original position was back open as the person they promoted from within, didn't work out. She said I had to come in to interview for the original position before she could present me to the other positions. I said that was fine, and finally scheduled my in person interview. She ensured me that even if I didn't get this position, she had 2 other positions and for me not to worry as I would definitely be working at Amazon. I was told by the recruiter to study the Amazon Principles and come up with real life work examples where I have applied the Principles in past work experiences. Do not walk in and waste your time if you don't have a lot of examples prepared. I was lead to a conference room where I would stay the entire day, except for leaving for a lunch break with an Amazon employee. I went in for my interviews and met with 4 of the 5 interviewers.The interviews were 45 minutes long each, The interviews I felt went really well, I was asked basic and situational questions. I gave thoughtful answers and gave different examples from past work experiences instead of giving the same answer to each interviewer. The interviewers made sure to remind me not to give the same answer (even though I didn't) as a lot of their questions are repeated. I was taken to lunch by an Amazon employee, which is also an interview- don't be fooled that its not.","The last interviewer did not show up.I was called by the recruiter, and apparently she was on vacation and didn't get the memo we were supposed to meet.

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"This interview process was challenging....It is very intense! The entire four-week process consisted of three phone calls/interviews, then an all-day on-site visit to Seattle HQ. The fIrst call was with an internal Recruiter - very high-level, explaining role/oppty. Second call was a phone interview with the hiring manager, and the third call was a phone interview with a peer. It was easier to have a chance to ask questions in the second phone interview (with the peer). It was a more relaxed interview than the one with the hiring manager. In both phone interviews, be prepared to answer a lot of ""situational"" questions relative to Amazon leadership principles + apply situations you've experienced in working past deals, or working with peers, or in past roles, directly to the leadership principles as you formulate your response. If you make it through the phone interviews (only 1 in 17 does), you will be invited to go through the LOOP at HQ. This process consists of an all-day series of interviews (with 5-7 people – usually 45 minutes each), as well as a 45-minute presentation. Lunch is spent with someone from the team, and that individual is not necessarily interviewing you (they tell you this), so it’s a great chance to ask questions in a more relaxed manner. The presentation is delivered to all interviewers, and is focused around either a use case for AWS or positioning your current company’s solution. The hiring manager was the CIO, one of the peers who interviewed me was the CMO, etc. They will ask you questions throughout the preso, and it’s super-important not to break character and stay in the roleplay. Each interviewer has a specific leadership principle or two, that they will be asking questions about. You need to think quick on your feet and answer the questions succinctly – focusing on the results of how you executed on that leadership principle. Some of the interviews are easier than others. There are a mix of personalities, and after talking for many hours straight, it’s challenging to stay focused. Shorter succinct, direct answers are usually better! Be prepared for things that may throw you off. One of my interviews was via video conferencing, for example. Bring a list of questions you have for the team. Each interviewer will ask their questions and give you 10 mins at the end to answer your questions. You should also be able to specifically tell the interview team WHY you want to work at Amazon. That was asked of me a few times."," TIP: (not a question they asked) Know the Amazon Leadership Principles and be prepared to effectively explain how you demonstrated those principles, relative to your past work experience!!   ",Amazon

No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"This was one of the weirdest and worst interviews I've ever had. There were so many red flags. I wasn't made an offer, but I would have declined if I had. The initial phone screening was fine...all technical questions just to see if I had a pulse. I was notified that the hiring process would advance within 24 hours after the screening. I was shortly flown out to Seattle to face a day-long gauntlet. Half of the interviewers seemed very uncomfortable, and it was clear they had no interest in being there and were there as part of a rotation. None of them came close to my experience with the hiring manager, though. This was for a position at their Herndon, VA datacenter. I was asked by the hiring manager if I would be interested in relocating to Seattle, which I politely explained that I would like to stay on the East coast. After all, the position was in Herndon. He dug further asking why, and even asked if I was married and what my wife did. I refused to answer the second part, which resulted in his reply that I would ""always be making more money than her"" and that I ""had no good reason to not want to relocate to Seattle."" I was so happy to leave their offices after that and have declined every opportunity to come back since. One of the other interviewers admitted that the work/life balance was awful, and that most people don't stay longer than two years due to burnout.

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I'm a university student. First applied through Amazon.job in mid October, got an email from a college hiring team a month later saying that they'd like to move forward to the interview process for the position at Seattle, WA (although here they mentioned it's at the headquarter, it still depends on your preference and their availability to put you into one of the offices across north america.) Sent some personal info and got an email that has a link to an online assessment site. The test was easy, only contains several debugging questions. You can run the code and see the results in the online IDE. Basic debugging skills are enough (try first output the result, you will most likely find the bug right away if you see the result. If you are using C or Java, printf or println would come in handy here if you struggle finding the bugs). Three weeks after the assessment (it was around Christmas holidays, so it should take less than 2 weeks.) got another email from a recruiter, asking for availability to schedule a phone interview. Wanted to conduct it through skype or google hangouts but they insisted doing it via a cellphone or landline. Phone reception sucks in my apartment so just bought a skype number for a few bucks and gave them the skype number. I'm majoring in CS, already started to prepare for coding interviews since 2nd year, coded most questions in Cracking The Coding Interview, and also applied to other companies like google, fb, microsoft. The questions are at the same level as those of google or fb. Definitely not difficult to think of, but it requires some coding skills. Detailed strategy depends on your interviewer, if your interviewer wants you to talk, then try to talk while you are thinking before start coding. Remember to ask your interviewer if he or she wants you to talk more or code quick. The interview went pretty good. Got enough time for two questions. The first one was just a tree question from cracking the coding interview. Some details were changed but main idea remains same. After coding the first question, still got about 20+ mins. The interviewer asked a 2nd question and stressed that it's a bonus question and I dont have to code it, just want me to give him a basic idea. The question was surprisingly easy though, still a data structure problem, main idea is to use tries. After briefly explaining my idea, I started to code it. Finished coding and got 5 mins to ask the interviewer some questions. I asked some pretty damn stupid questions and was worring that I would lose the offer just because of these stupid questions. Only made a small mistake in the 2nd question, realized it right away. was able to code the first question perfectly without any mistakes. This is important. Do not make too many small mistakes or it's just not likely that you would get an offer.

No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I received an e-mail from a recruiter saying they came across my resume and felt I would be a good fit for their ""Team Leader"" position. I went ahead and applied and within 24 hours they sent me a small assessment to take and 2 days after that they said I was proceeding to the next portion of the interview (face-to-face). To be completely honest I felt a little uneasy about the whole thing because I felt like it was moving super fast and how they found my resume to begin with I'm still trying to figure out. (It wasnt uploaded in their system). Well anyways the interview took place in Orlando and I live there so it was not a big deal for me to drive 20 mins and see what would happen. There was about 5 or 6 others at the office where the interview was being conducted and most of them were not even from the area. In fact they flew in, stayed in a hotel, and Amazon covered the expense. Now i was really confused about this whole thing because if Amazon was paying airfares and hotel expenses for candidates then this must be some type of serious gig. Meanwhile Im still here wondering what exactly I'm doing there and how they even found me. But like i said I proceeded in the interview which was a 15 minute math problem, then two 45 minute interviews. One was situational type questions and the other was behavior. The interview was one of the more difficult ones I have had and i was a little fatigued by the end. None the less im glad i got the experience as i felt even if i was offered the job it was not something i would've accepted.

It was as described; phone interview which included a math flow question and 3 behavioral questions. It was a 45 minute process. My interview was late in the evening. I was emailed by the recruiter about the next steps the very next day. They scheduled the (hopefully) final interview in a different city. It started with a tour of the fulfillment center, then there was a math flow question, for which we were given 15 minutes. This was followed by 4 different interviews; it is random and you might not answer the math flow question to start with. Don't get scared by the math question, take a deep breath and read it once or twice. I did that and was able to correctly answer it in less than 7 minutes. The person that talked about the math flow question with me was the one that talked to me about the case study. Then I was walked to a senior operations manager for a second interview. My 3rd interview was with HR, and then my final one was with the site leader. They pretty much ask about 3-4 behavioral questions which could all be the same. I had a great experience.

Twelve days after the phone call, I received another email from the recruiting coordinator who proposed to move forward with the interview process and schedule a second call with a couple of other people (potential future co-workers at the same level as the job I was applying for). This call lasted about 1 hour, it was very technical and challenged me to think about risk. I could not really prepare for the questions I was asked so my answers were entirely based on my past experience. There were moments when I had to pause and give a serious consideration to the question I was being asked (e.g. You are auditing a billing system, what type of risks would you consider as part of your work?). I thought I did pretty well and eventually I was invited for an onsite interview (approximately 1 month after the second phone interview). The onsite interview lasted from 10 AM until 4PM. Met with approximately 6 people (45 min each meeting). The interview started with the most senior people progressing to the most junior. I enjoyed the interviews with the most senior people and less so with the junior staff. Out of 6 interviewers only one was very technical and asked technical questions. My overall impression was that I did very well on the interview, however I did not get an offer. Obviously Amazon does not provide feedback on the interview however they encouraged me to apply again. I was not super psyched about working for Amazon and it is possible that this came through without me being even aware. At the end of the day I was wiped and started getting annoyed being asked pretty much the same questions just rephrased differently. My last interviewer was even openly yawning in my face. Btw one of the requirements for the onsite interview as to provide a writing sample (2 pages, single spaced, 11 point). I provided it in advance of the deadline but it was never discussed by anyone during the interview. Also one interviewer said that he never got it, which led me to think that someone dropped the ball on it. All in all application process for this job (applying online to final result) took 90 days. My overall impression is that Amazon is an ok company (just as the score on Glassdoor indicates) however their interview processes are definitely in need improvement.

I get frustrated with Amazon's hit-or-miss interviewing style. They ask you these situational questions without any context and it's really a gamble whether you answer it just right. They say it works for them but when their average tenure is 14 months, I have to question whether it's really working or not."," I am sorry, I seemed to have blocked the whole thing out of my memory   ",Amazon
No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Initial interview with a recruiter. After the first phone ""screening"", they had me do a case study that was due within 2 days. After submission, they notified me the following week to say that they would like to move forward with the first interview. I was hoping that the interview would be based on sales strategies, as I was applying for an Account Manger position, but they were all behavioral questions.

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Passed my resume to a recruiter via LinkedIn and was contacted a few days later to schedule an Initial Screening with the Hiring Manager. I was then invited to the Amazon HQ for 6 in-person interviews about 2 weeks later. The interviews were about 45 minutes each and focused on Amazon's leadership principles. I was surprised by the number of behavior based questions there were, the interviewers would really dive deep to get the specifics of each answer you gave, but it didn't feel like an interrogation it was more like a conversation, which was nice! It was clear that everyone I met was incredibly smart and really looking for ""Amazon"" personality fit at this point. My best advice is to study Amazon's leadership principles along with your resume and be ready to go into great detail about how you showcased those same principles, be open to sharing your thought process and support anecdotes with quantifiable data as much as possible."," Tell me about a time you had a goal and made a plan to accomplish it, but competing requirements got in the way?
