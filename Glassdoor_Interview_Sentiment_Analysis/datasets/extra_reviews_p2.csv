 Tell me about a time in your career where you have had to handle an time-sensitive emergency.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I understand this is a large organization and that the interview experience will be different depending on the role and business unit. The position I interviewed for was a more specialized senior level back office role in a somewhat specialized business unit. The process started with a simple phone screen where I did most of the talking. This was followed by two video conferences (during the pandemic) which turned out to be the most ridiculous interviews I have experienced in my career, prompting me to write this harsh review. First, instead of coordinating a convenient day and time for the second-round interview, the business unit leader emailed me directly with both the day and time this person wanted to speak, and asked me only to confirm I would be available. The lack of courtesy and regard for my time was concerning, but I went along with it and adjusted my calendar accordingly to accommodate the request. The business unit leader and someone from this person’s team spoke to me in the first conference which lasted 90 minutes. There was a strict “script” that had to be followed and I was asked boilerplate questions throughout; however, the business unit leader kept interrupting me, kept “going off script” and made bizarre statements throughout. This person kept reiterating that the company is “highly regulated” and therefore the script must be followed for audit and other purposes, yet this person kept going “of script”. This person also harped on the company’s and the team’s diversity which, as a person of color, I found disingenuous. Regardless, I felt I may not be the right candidate for the role given my understanding of this person’s needs – so you can imagine my surprise when I received a second request from the same business unit leader to speak again for a third round interview on a date and time already selected for me. I again adjusted my calendar to accommodate the request, and again, it was more of the same. In fact, this same person cut me off repeatedly and even got loud with me at times while the other participant remained respectful. By the end of this conference, after 3 hours of interviewing with this person, it was clear I wanted nothing to with this role or working with that individual. I never followed up and did receive a boilerplate rejection email several weeks later. The fact this company allows certain managers to go unchecked and conduct interviews in this unprofessional manner was disturbing, and I will certainly take this into account should I ever decide to apply for a position at this organization in the future.",wellsfargo

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Phone interview with 2 District Managers. Questions were somewhat basic however the response they are looking for is not always direct to the question.

Inside tip, if you get a question that is vague have them elaborate or better explain the question because trust me you may respond completely wrong. I was a little thrown by the feedback I received but it is what it is. Ultimately it will depend on how well you interact with the actual person that would be your direct manager and how well you click. Try to do an in person interview as opposed to a phone interview. I feel it took away from showing who I am in person and how personable I am. I work really well with people and I can mirror anyone. The recruiter was very open to giving me feedback which I greatly appreciated. Even the best of us need a reality check every now and then. I am a little rusty on interviewing however I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Do not get discouraged if you are not chosen.

I was a manager before, I am used to describe situations as we/ my team, when I was answering one of the questions, I accidentally said “we” instead of “I”, right away he yelled at me on the phone, he said” you keep saying we! What do you mean we? Who are we? I am asking you! Why are you using we?” After hearing him shouting at me on the phone, I was like, wow is that a cultural thing in Wells Fargo? Obviously he doesn’t care about his employees or just maybe just candidates. However, even though your candidate made a small mistake, you should not be yelling at he/she on the first interview like the way he did! BTW, I am not a native English speaker, so yes sometimes I make small mistake in grammar, but I don’t deserve being treat like that! In the end of the phone interview, I still said thank you for his time and hope he has a good day, he didn’t say anything and hung up the phone. Well, Wells Fargo expect their employees provide great customer service to their customers, but if this is a common thing in Wells Fargo how they treat candidates during interviews, then good luck to you if you decide to accept the offer! :)",wellsfargo

Overall the in person interview was tough but didn't last too long. 30 minutes. The number of questions was reasonable.

 Tell me about yourself.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"An administrative assistant set-up the initial phone screening and passed on a phone number I was to call to dial into the conference room. The interviewer was late, so I sat on hold in the conference room lobby for a bit. Interviewer didn't even say hello when he entered the call. The hold music just stopped. When I confirmed he was in the meeting he was difficult to hear. He then proceeded to only ask maybe three questions. Every time I answered a question he was just silent on the other end, but I could hear him clicking away on his keyboard. It was strictly Q&A and not at all interactive. He'd pause for a weirdly long time after each question. I had to confirm he was still there at one point because he didn't even say things like ""I see"" or ""mmhmm"" while he was writing his notes. After the third question (at which point we'd basically only covered ""tell me about yourself"" and ""what interests you about this role"" he said ""well I had other questions, but you pretty much answered them already with your other responses so I guess we're done."" I tried to ask him a few questions about the position and he only provided very vague, overly succinct answers. Then I received a form letter the next day saying I wasn't selected for the role, which makes sense. How could I have been? They learned literally nothing about me in the process.

After she read through the questions and typed my answers (very loudly) she told me someone from the branch would call in about a week if I was selected to move on. Less than an hour later I got a phone call from someone at the branch to schedule an in person interview. From what I had read I went in full suit and I'm glad I did because everyone else was in a suit. For the in person interview I had 2 service managers in a very small conference room ask questions off a list and take notes about my answers. They were much more personable and gave good feedback and reaction to my answers. It felt more like a conversation than an interrogation. The questions were the expected situational questions that I was prepared for and I thought it did very well. They said they had a lot of other applicants to interview and not to expect to hear from then until the following week. It's been an additional week so I assume one of the other candidates was more what they were looking for.",wellsfargo

 Very basic interview questions; why are you interested in this position?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Very slow hiring process. From submitting the job application to landing an interview the duration took over 3 months. The only reason I was offered an interview was due to an external recruiter to which had rapport with the hiring manager. Even though my profile was submitted and screened the conventional way it took an outside recruiter to speed things up. All and all it was a very grueling time consuming process I’ve never encountered from any top bank. After the interview concluded, was told feedback would be given on next steps well two weeks went by and silence. I gave up reaching out to the external recruiter who would inform me the hiring manager is in other words busy. A tell tale sign if they’re too slow to interview and/or offer feedback just imagine what the department culture is deemed to be like if I was hired. Essentially, a culture that is inconsiderate of its employees time and dedication. So I withdrew my candidacy. And the caveat is that they didn’t have other top candidates because once I withdrew my application the position reposted the very next day.

But it never felt right, and at one point the man stopped the woman to ask a question about what a current employee was doing outside. At the point I felt I was never going to get the job and it’s fine if I don’t, but it’s not right to make someone feel like that during an interview. It felt like you aren’t even trying to listen to me and what I have to tell you about my experience. The man made it so obvious, right when I walked in. I have been to several interviews this was by far the most awkward. I just feel like I was judged and not even listened to. I really believe I was discrimated against. I hated this interview and was the worst unprofessional experience.",wellsfargo
 Why did you choose Wells Fargo?   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied to every Wells Fargo branch that had a open teller position around my city. I got three interviews out of the five applications I submitted. The first interview was over the phone. That interview was honestly quite awkward.

The questions were your basic ""describe a time... and name an experience"" type of questions. The interview went great and the people were honest and nice. A couple days later I got a call from a recruiter saying they wanted to offer me the position and gave me all the details about the pay and stuff.

They thought I was overqualified and would not be open to taking the position that I took the time to apply and interview for. It was definitely a weird experience.",wellsfargo

The campus is huge and its easy to get lost, I was told to go to building 104 but I had to drive right up to the door to see it because that was the only visible building number. I had to sign in twice, maybe 10 steps apart. When I talked to the interviewer, she was very short, seemed annoyed. Stopped me constantly throughout the interview to ask for more information, much of which wasn't pertinent to the question she asked or even had to do with my actions but those of my former company before I spoke to the customer mentioned in the story. She asked if I had submitted applications with any other companies, of course I have, she made it seem like that was wrong. She made it seem like the few months that I had been unemployed was wrong, even though I was laid off and was actively looking for another job (but me applying for any other jobs was wrong?)

At one point in the interview, she started talking down to me because most of my experience was in a brokerage and not exactly what she was looking for. She had me explain to her what a stock was.

First she said, listen to each question and determine what behavior they are looking for. Like attention to detail, integrity, teamwork, problem solving, building collaborative teams, developing strategy, etc. Based on your response, WF then scores your answer on a 5 point scale. My friend said they also don't check out your examples and that everyone embellishes their examples and she said to get past this stage of the interview, to make sure my examples specifically illustrate the behavior.

On the way back home when I was driving, I was just thinking, Wells Fargo???..... So, never be disappointed with yourself. Wells Fargo is not the only company in the world and their recruiter may not know your potential. They don't know you are a loyal employee, a super hard working person and a young profession who wants to dedicate the whole life for them. Someone else will see your shinning point.

Also if you are offered more than 1, you can't turn down the first, and take another one. Once you accept you are in. If you withdraw and try to take a different one, you will be denied the offer for the 2nd one. And kiss good bye any chances of working there in the future.",wellsfargo

 Salary requirements?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Applied during the week of October 5th and received a call from the VP of the Tax Ops department on the 14th of October to schedule an telephonic interview with her and her manager on the 15th. I was asked your ""typical"" situational questions that seemed endless. Whenever I thought the Head Interviewer was done, another question would follow. One would have assumed they were interviewing for a managerial type of position. Overall, both Hiring Managers were friendly and knowledgeable about their department. Fast forward to November 11, I received a call from HR informing me that the manager was interested but first needed to know my salary requirements. Internally, this evoked excitement because finally I thought I might be heading West while leaving my home state of (NJ) behind. My excitement, dampened, after being told not only do I have to provide my salary requirements, but I had to interview also with HR which I thought was backwards and pointless. If I already interviewed with the folks that know what they are seeking in a candidate based on our background, if not then they wouldn't have called us directly, then why those positioned in these HR roles insist on interviewing after the candidate interviewed with the people that is responsible for making the final decision? Isn't that backwards? As our conversation progressed, I became flustered by the minute. With other positions I held in the past, usually the candidate will receive a rejection email or a call from HR extending an offer after the interview process concluded. This is why I became confused. The HR lady did not want to verbally utter, ""yes this is an extended offer"" instead she kept saying this is the next step in the process calling candidates to determine their salary requirements. Granted, if it's not an ""offer"" you're calling me about, why call me? Anyway, after reciting my background and alerting her why I should assume the role, and communicating my salary requirements, the HR woman tried to downplay the range. Please note, they do not want to offer minorities a salary they are worth, and prefer to abridge the entire process. When HR told me how much the position is worth (by the way, was very low) I challenged her by informing her that the Head Interviewer discussed salary in our ""interview"" and told me the highest they were willing to give the candidate. With this information I presented to HR, she then redacted and all of a sudden agreed. It is funny that they'll try to give you the lowest salary all the while knowing the position is worth a lot more. Before I conversation concluded, I informed her again of my salary range and she as in the HR lady informed me (which was a lie) that she will relay my range to the Hiring Managers and I should expect a call from her the next day on November 12th. Yeah right, the 12th came and went, until today December 3, I emailed her and it was then that she alerted me that the Hiring Managers have decided to move forward with an internal candidate. Okay, that is fine, but when was I going to know? After their background cleared or they got acclimated? Bogus people. The process almost took 2 months just for them to tell me they are pursuing an internal candidate. Beware of this scandalous company and shady HR.

There was 8 of us in the group and the ladies seemed very nice after the awkward silence was broken right before the interview. There was a packet of information about Wells Fargo and the dress code along with an availability application were had to fill out. The recruiter comes in on time and starts the interview by introducing herself, informing us about the company and the position we applied for and then let's us introduce ourselves. She then asked us three interview questions. It was a competition to be one of the first to answer the question but the recruiter was kind enough to let us all have a chance to answer and also give us feedback of what she got of what we told her about ourselves. She then let us know that normally that contact us within 3 to 5 business days but because of Labor Day weekend and the back to back interviews that they are doing that they will contact us in two weeks. After the interview I emailed the recruiter a thank you note reminding her of my customer service experience and that I'm still interested in the position. I feel that I did very well. I wore a suit with heels. There was one other woman that wore a suit and surprising three of the ladies were very inappropriately dressed for an interview and one woman even was showing cleavage. But we all did very well. I don't normally wear makeup but I wore a little just to look nice but not too much. I smiled the whole time even when the other ladies were answering. I was super nervous at first but as we started talking I got more comfortable. On September 16 I was super anxious and hadn't heard from the recruiter. So I emailed her and she emailed me back immediately saying I passed the group interview and she is finalizing a date for the final interview the manager at the branch I'm interested in.

 How is average life calculated?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Applied and heard back about a month later. initial phone screen with HR went well and then followed a call with the hiring manager. That call also went well so they brought me in for the full day (10am -6pm) interview. I believe I met with 8 or 9 people, including 2 of them for lunch. It appears that each interviewer is there to test a skill/personality of some sort. First was to see if I can mesh well with the company, second was to test my interpersonal skills, third was to get an understanding of what I used to do, fourth was to see how I handle different situations. There were several more interviews but the one I will never forget is the guy who tested my technical skills. He was supposed to be a finance wiz who is also very good with spreadsheets (which he very well could be) but when I explained to him what I used to do, he looked puzzled and made some remarks that weren't remotely true of the industry I used to work in. So when it came down to showing him how I used to do things on the whiteboard, I took a very sky high approach to explain the inner workings. That worked against me as I did not get the position for the reason being I wasn't as sharp in finance as they thought I was. Lesson here (for future interviewees) is to never assume and even when they look like they don't have a clue about what you're talking about, crush them even it means using finance lingos, greeks and statistical analysis.",wellsfargo

 If a customer has received a phishing email from a suspicious sender what would you advise the customer to do?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Applied for online fraud detection. If you are selected by a first level recruiter to schedule a phone interview you will get automated email with a link to set it up. For me it took about 2 weeks from when I applied. Next step was a phone interview with second level interview, which she asked about my previous work history related to research and decision making and knowledge of Wells Fargo systems. One thing about Wells Fargo hiring process for Teller, Phone Bankers, Financial Crimes Specialist and some other positions if the second level recruiter does not immediately schedule a face-to-face interview with a supervisor immediately after the conversation then he/she did not choose to move forward with you even though you will be told that a decision will be made a week from now. This time I was finally scheduled for an interview with two supervisors in online fraud detection. Wells Fargo will usually have you interview with two supervisors but only one is the hiring manager. Wells Fargo supervisors use the situation, task, action, and result method of questioning which is very structured and can be difficult to fit a specific situation into the question. This was fraud detection so qustions were related to making difficult decisions, using available resources at your disposal, soliciting information to customers. After waiting for another 3 weeks I received the automated decline email that I was not offered the position.",wellsfargo

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I went in for a group interview and there was 9 other people that were applying for the same position some for the same city we interviewed at and some for different cities. When we first started the lady told us ""to be relaxed, because if everyone in the room is a good fit than everyone in this room will get a position with the company"". Which I felt was false information, and she only said that so she could see how we'd react to the statement she just made. She asked everyone two questions, and based off of the answers you respond with, that would determine if you go into the next round or not. Which is stupid because how can you get to know someone off of two questions, especially when everyone is looking at you in the entire room. Maybe I'm just old fashion but I believe interviews should always be one on one, I understand they do group interviews to make the process easier and faster, but this interview was one of the worst interviews I've ever had in my life. Believe me, I've been to countless interviews in my life time and this was just the worst ever.",wellsfargo

During the interview each person had to play a teller scenario which to me was the hardest part and seem to be hard for everyone else but for one person who worked at Wells Fargo before. She let us know that she would be going off of how we dressed to the interview, how we answered the questions, and did we give eye contact.

 Everything- You better not miss 1 question or they will embarrass you.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was contacted by a member of the IT department to schedule a phone interview. The phone interview was a conference call with 3 others. They literally read off a long list of Java concept questions and were looking for short, exact answers. It was a completely impersonal and strict phone interview, in which they only cared if the answers were correct to the questions. A week later, after apparently passing the technical phone screen, I was invited in for a face-to-face interview . I traveled from Cleveland, OH during the middle of the week to meet with Wells Fargo. Upon arriving, I was taken up to the IT floor with no warm welcome or anything. Right away, the 1st of four interviewers met with me and from then on, I don't think one interviewer said a single thing in even the slightest friendly manner. Every single interviewer spend 45 minutes ridiculing me for having no experience and not having knowledge of certain tools and concepts, even though I am in still attending College. They were strict, nasty, and the rudest people I have ever encountered in a business environment. They pulled out tablets and looked up Java technical questions and completed embarrassed me for the questions I got incorrect. For about half of the ones i got ""wrong"", I knew the answer and voiced it, but since it was not word for word correct, they would tell me I'm wrong. They wanted me to be wrong, and had no interest in letting me try to explain my answer. They spent the entire interview lecturing me about how I needed to go back to school and learn tools, concepts, and other things. Rather than simply stating ""You may not have the experience with these certain tools that we are looking for"", they rudely told me that I was a bad candidate and that they couldn't believe I dd not have experience with the tools they use. I was even told that ""my school sucked"". I have never had an interview like this and I was completely shocked by the amount of unprofessional-ism that these interviewers had. Since it was an entry-level position, I asked how the learning process was within the department, and asked what methods were used to advance the entry-level programmers. The interviewer responded by rudely laughing at me and telling me ""Welcome to corporate America. There is no training. You are on your own and nobody has time for you"". I cannot believe that I traveled 7 hours to be treated in this manner, and I can NEVER possibly even imagining to work for such a rude, arrogant, and lifeless company.

 What was one time in customer service when you went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate a customer. Maybe they were upset. What did you do and were you recognized?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"After applying online, you will receive an e-mail with a link to go through a screening process. The screening process is just several questions about your past sales experience and experience with sales goals. If you pass the screening, you will find out if you got an interview IMMEDIATELY and you sign up for an interview time. The first interview is a group interview at a common location (most likely corporate or a training center). They ask one question that the entire group has to answer individually. My group was asked, ""What was one time in customer service when you went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate a customer. Maybe they were upset. What did you do and were you recognized?"" After the group interview, you will receive an email or phone call from a branch in the area you applied saying to come in for another more personal interview one-on-one, or that you were not considered. I moved on to the personal interview and it is exactly what you would expect from any other interviewer. They stress highly the expectations you will have to achieve sales goals. I was told at the time that I was very liked and the Lead Teller told me she wished she could hire me right then but had other interviews she was required to do. At her request, I dropped my college courses and re-enrolled entirely in to new classes with poor evening times and low quality professors. She told me she would call me by the end of the week after she talked to her manager. A week and a half later, I received the least personal email that almost sounded automated telling me that other candidates seemed ""more qualified"" and I was encouraged to apply again in the future. This was all after wasting 2 months of my time and a lot of gas to drive to the head training center 2 hours one way. I am very displeased with the quality and process as a whole. This position has high wages with VERY nice benefits so I would still recommend trying, but do not hold your breath as they are known to lead you on.",wellsfargo

The thing that took me by surprise and stopped me from working for the company previously is the 80 hours of training that you have to do Monday thru Friday from 8 to 5. This is MANDATORY. I implore you to think and understand this before you try to interview with this job. As a college student I certainly couldn't do it when the semester started and was very disappointed,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"Wells Fargo has a relatively easy interview process as far as getting an interview. You simply fill out an application and if you pass the assessment you can set up a time and day for your interview. The first interview is usually a group interview at a central location. I interviewed on two seperate occasions because the first time I couldn't work in the training hours. However, now on my second attempt in the interview process I went to my group interview which had only 3 other candidates. Supposedly there was supposed to be more but we were the only ones that showed. After some introductions we watched a video and answer behavioral questions. Everyone gets a chance to answer, but in my case on both occasions no one wanted to answer first so it made me look really strong when I went first with my answers. That is definitely something they will remember. Another thing that will help you is if you rehearse your answers. The questions are all the same, but having an answer that is well thought out and prepared shows that you have done your homework and are more than qualified to do this job. It is also another thing that recruiters notice and could help you get that second interview. After the group interview the recruiter told us that she would contact us in about two weeks to inform us either way about the job. I received a call an hour later and was told that I did exceptionally well and would be moving on. I then set up an appointment with the store manager at the bank I applied for. However, when I went in for the interview the manager I was supposed to interview with had a death in the family so I ended up being interview by a different manager. I handled business as usual and had a good interview. She told me to expect a call in a week because that was the time the original manager would be back. A week later I got the call asking me to come in again and she made me an offer.",wellsfargo

It was a great experience but they really make their hiring process a rat race.

They told us if we received another invitation, via mail, that we would then be interviewed by a panel either in Downtown LA or surrounding. After receiving that letter, we all met as a group in one of their local offices. We were paired up and interviewed 3 times as our names were called. The panel consisted of current branch managers which were also paired up into 3 teams. Our first ""scenario"" was to pretend they are the customer and we are the employee and we went thru the welcome, self intro, to discussing the ""customer's need to visit the branch, and picking up on the conversation to see if the ""customer"" had a need for a product or service to better help them. The second ""scenario"" consisted of us applicants sharing a story where we thought we went above and beyond for a past customer or if we think we stood up for what we believed was the right thing to do even though our past employer was not right in something that was happening at the time. The last ""scenario"" was about any sales experience we had and how we overcame obstacles. The whole time we were reminded that they seek energetic applicants that are aware that this is a SALES position.

I wore a traditional black dress with a little pearl necklace, bracelet, and earrings. I had never been to a group interview so I was initially pretty nervous. It was actually a really comfortable interview. I was in the room sitting at a conference table being interviewed with about 10 other people. The recruiter asked us to go around the table and tell everyone about ourselves. (This was the perfect chance to brag about yourself and your experience!) Then she asked us two other questions. One was, ""Tell me about an experience where you had to go above and beyond for a customer."" I shared an experience about when I worked in retail. Another question asked was to share a story about a time where you were required to meet a sales goal, and how you went about doing it. It was a pretty easy interview. I was prepared because I went on glassdoor before hand and practiced my answers to the questions everyone had listed. The interview process took about 2 1/2 hours. I believe it was because there were so many people in the room, and everyone was required to answer each question. At the end of the group interview, the recruiter asked me and 2 other girls to stay so she could ask us a few more questions. I take it the other interviewers didn't get offered a job. The reason she asked us to stay behind is because she wanted to schedule a second interview with us and the general manager the next day. I of course said yes, and the second interview went extremely well. They are mostly interested in hearing about your sales experience. If you had previous cash handling experience, they're interested in knowing how much cash you were responsible for, they want to know why you left your last job, how you deal with unhappy customers, and how you deal with overage/shortage of cash.

The hiring manager basically explained the position to us, WF benefits, her background, asked a few informational EXTREMELY easy to answer questions. Lasted about an hour and didn't even realize it.

Not even a full 30 minutes later, I received the call and was offered a position. So this all happened in less than 2 days!",wellsfargo

She asked me a lot of questions about my experience--basically reviewing my resume in detail.

I met with a regional manager and a branch manager (not for the branch I would be hired at) a week later. I usually interview very well, but the regional manager looked bored and the branch manager was the one who asked most of the questions. It was generic questioning for the most part. They mostly grilled me on the bank I currently work for (which is completely different than WF...my bank does not push sales as much and I knew this going into it). They also asked me to talk about a specific sales goal that I met. At the end of the interview, the regional manager added some questions which I thought were kind of silly. What would you do if you got hired? What would you do if you didn't get hired? And he expressed concern over the fact that my bank doesn't push sales as much as they do. I told them more than once that I wanted to be in a sales environment...that I am looking for a challenge and want to have agressive goals. That even though my goals now may not be AS agressive, I'm still the best sales person in my branch. He said that of course I was, because I waited on the majority of the customers and it was a small branch. I felt that was kind of negative and I did not have a good feeling about him. If I get the job, I will be surprised. Even though I am up for the challenge, it seems like they are looking for someone who already has agressive sales goals. It's ashame because I was/am really excited about the prospect of working there, and I know that I would do a great job. If it wasn't for the attitude of the RM, I would say the interview went well. I have a THIRD interview on 9/7/12 with the branch manager of the branch that, if hired, I will be working for. This is an incredibly long process. Hopefully I get hired!

 It's towards the end of the month and you're not pacing to meet your sales goals. What will you do to ensure that you meet the goals required?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"If you're selected for an interview you will be called by a recruiter for the interview. It varies based on the region as to how the interview will take place, but from my experience and knowledge your interview is typically with the district manager, in a corporate office of Wells Fargo. At times I have heard the interview could be at the branch, with the branch manager and District Manager, but this has typically been more so for internal employees posting for a promotion. The interview process isn't very personable AT ALL. You sit down with the DM, and he/she literally has a little interview packet/questionnaire that they ask you. The questions are so generic that you could probably prepare yourself by going to eHow and typing in ""interview questions."" They use something called the S.T.A.R. format, which means for each question they're looking for the beginning of the situation/store, details leading up to the peak of the story, and then details leading up to how the situation/store was resolved. Here are some of the questions I was asked and most people applying for my position within my district were asked: 1) Tell me about a time when you had an angry customer. What happened, and how did you resolve the situation. 2) It's towards the end of the month and you're not pacing to meet your sales goals. What will you do to ensure that you meet the goals required? 3) This position requires lots of multi-tasking. Tell me about a time where you have had a lot going on in one day. How did you prioritize and multi-task to ensure all your tasks were finished accordingly? There are more/different questions as well. At the end they will ask you if you have any questions and then will let you know that you'll hear back within X amount of days. Typically the recruiter will call you back within a week to offer you the position if you've met their guidelines.",wellsfargo
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied online and approximately two weeks later was contacted by the Wells Fargo recruiter. She asked me to attend a Group Interview the following day at their local office. The day after the Group Interview I was asked to schedule an interview with two of their Branch Managers. The questions for both interviews were very straight forward without any really challenging questions. From there I was scheduled to interview with the Regional Manager but he never showed up for the interview nor did he call to apologize. The recruiter called me asking if I could come in another day. At that point I let her know that I was no longer interested because it just did not seem like a good fit for me. I was overqualified for the job and the compensation was insulting.,wellsfargo
 Why should we hire you?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online for a teller position.

The group interview included about 12 other candidates for the position and took place in a round table conference room in a business building. This included all of the basic questions you would expect at an interview, nothing really surprised me. Once I made it past this interview, I received a call from a manager at a local branch for an interview with him and the assistant manager. I unfortunately did not get offered a job after this interview.

When I went in for the day of my interview, I had to have one with the Service Manager and the Manager of the branch I was trying to get the job at. She claimed she was only there to listen, but she butted in a few times to ask questions of her own. About a week later, I got an e-mail saying that I didn't get the job and it didn't say why.

Watched a 10 minute film about Wells Fargo and the the recruiter went around the room and ask each applicant the same questions: Tell me about yourself, What was your biggest sales accomplishment and how you achieved it, What other langugages do you speak and what area would you like to work in). There were only a few including myself that had banking experience (over 10 years in banking, 8 of them as a Personal Banker) , everyone else were retail.

" The questions were pretty routine, and the one that always trips me up is an example of failure. No one likes to highlight their failures, but the hiring managers want to know what kinds of things trip you up, how you handle it, and what you learn from it.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"There is a multi-step screening process that likely filters out a lot of good candidates. HR screeners filter through applications and weed out dozens of applicants just based on paper stats. The next step is to do a phone interviewer, again with an HR screener. This interview is short and to the point, they just want to get an idea of your personality and confirm a few facts about your resume. This likely cuts the talent pool in half or more again. By the time this step is done they have taken (for example) a pool of 50 applicants down to less than 10. At this point they make recommendations to the actual hiring managers of the ""best"" candidates. Then you get a phone interview or in-person interview with your actual future manager. Questions are experienced based, so make sure you have plenty of actual examples of previous experience or work to explain in detail. This could be a big project you helped work on, a great idea that you pushed to get implemented, and also try to have a failure ready because they want to see examples of how you handle failure.",wellsfargo

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Called the toll number, which turned out to be a phone interview. After the phone interview, I was emailed telling me what the next process was, which was a group interview. I called the number to schedule my group interview for the following week. The recruiter was about five minutes late to this interview. At the group interview, the recruiter asked us to introduce ourselves & why did we pick Wells Fargo. There was about 8 other people. Second question was explain a time you went above & beyond for a customer. Third question was how did you deal with an angry customer. At the end of the group interview, she passed a paper around that had 2 lines that normal tellers would have to say on a daily basis (scripts). She went around and asked us to read one out of the 2 lines. About 2 weeks later, the recruiter called me and told me that they wanted to go ahead and interview me for my 2:1 however, there were no positions open at the time so she will call me when there was one available. A week after that, I received the call and she asked me to pick from one of two locations. She sent me an email describing that it would be a 2:1 & listed the service manager & store managers' names as well. This interview is why I think my experience would be ""negative"". My 2:1 interview actually got changed to a 1 on 1 interview with only the service manager. He took me to a small room where we sat side by side like we were taking a test (awkward) and he asked me questions like 'How would you sell me a new product? How would you deal with an angry customer? What does your schedule look like? What do your friends tell you about the company? He also kept mentioning that it is a very sales based job, and that they report numbers on a daily basis. Throughout my interview, he kept flipping through my application that he printed out & kept looking for questions to ask me. This interview lasted about 15 minutes, 5 minutes would probably be him flipping the papers. After he ran out of questions, he told me to wait there to see if the store manager would like to interview me. He came back and said, ""No, he said hes good"" which I think is a little rude because that was the STORE MANAGER. If i was hired I would be working for him in particular. Right off the bat, I had a feeling I wasted my time even coming to the interview. About a week & a half later, I got an email saying they went with someone else.",wellsfargo

First, the same questions as the group interview. Then, some personal questions. What is a team work? Expecting role playing to sale something to the manager.

,Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"So you apply to all the job postings that you want online wellsfargo.com/careers.

Then you'll get a choice as to when you would like to attend a group interview. This is for your entire metropolitan area. You interview with a recruiting officer. The group interview is about 2 hours long. You have to apply for all the job postings you want online again. Then you'll get an email telling you you can come for another interview-it is either one on one or another group interview. Or you'll get one saying they chose to go a different direction. If you get the former you'll go to a group interview-at least in my case- with a hiring panel. It has the district manager, and the managers at all the stores that have openings in the area. They'll ask you questions. Then at that point they write what they like about you and send it to recruitment who then makes the final decisions. Then the recruiting officer will either call you or email you telling you if you got the job. But careful, then you have to do an online application, set up a date for a fingerprint analysis, then the background check officialpy starts which could take a while. The. After that clears it's another week or two until you go into 2 weeks of mandatory 8-5 training. All in all the hiring process is about 6-8 weeks. It's long for an entry level job. Tips- you don't have to be the first one to answer all of the questions but try to be the third or forth, because sometimes they'll skip to the next question for the sake of time Smile: look the interviewer straight in the eye and smile and make eye contact even when they're talking to the whole group. Dress: Dress better then you think you should. Wear a suit. For girls a blazer and work pants is perfect. They should be wrinkle free and ironed. Stick with neutral colors and minimal makeup. Girls don't ever wear bold lipstick to an interview it's just not appropriate. And no chipped nail polish. Guys- if you wear a suit don't wear a black tie- it's only appropriate for funerals and weddings. Make sure your socks don't show and your tie should match your shirt. Sales- what they're looking for the most is cash experience and sales experience. And people who can learn quickly and easily. Extra friendly is the key word here. They also have customer satisfaction surveys so if you're not great with customers it might not be the right fit.",wellsfargo

The phone screening was fairly standard as far as questions and I would consider to be easy. The group interview is extremely intimidating because not only do the managers hear your answers to the questions but the other applicants do as well and you cant help but analyze who you think your real competition for the position will be. The questions are fairly personal and the interview lasted roughly a little more than an hour with 8-10 applicants total. The questions at the last interview at the branch were similar to the group interview. My particular experience was incredibly frustrating because I actually went through the process of the branch interview 3 times due to the first 2 branches wanting to hire me but hiring someone who had previously interviewed before me who they also wanted to hire before but didn't. Instead of then being immediately hired by the other branch, they wanted another interview. I believe I had 5 interviews in all.",wellsfargo

That same day, I was given a call by the recruiter, and asked to attend a 2nd interview scheduled for 2 weeks later. At that interview, which was at the actual WF office, I had a panel interview.

I called the number to set up the appointment and waited on hold for like 10 minutes before someone answered to basically take a message. I got a call back the next day and they told me there were no appointments available.

There were about 20 people there total and it lasted almost 3 hours. We reviewed the requirements for the position, learned some about Wells Fargo, and answered two questions. They were about a situation where you provided excellent customer service and a time you met a goal.

Two weeks after the second interview I received a call from the recruiter stating that I had not been selected. Not getting the job wasn't nearly as bad as the waiting and knowing something had gone wrong with my paperwork. It's a huge disappointment not to know whether I didn't get the job because I wasn't qualified, or because of some sort of miscommunication on their part.",wellsfargo

They gave different scenarios and you had to speak in front of the rest of the group of people.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,The interview process felt like going on American Idol when they have the group eliminations. You are in a room with about 40 other candidates and they eliminate people by groups of 5 to 10 until there are about ten people left.

Since I currently hold a sales job, they tailored a lot of their questions towards my interaction with clients. They asked what my most difficult situation was with a client, as well as what was my most rewarding experience on the job. They definitely try to get you to slip up when they ask the same question more than once, but word it differently.

After the face-to-face interview, you will be called by the recruiter who will offer you the position.",wellsfargo
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,First things first was applying online. I went on to the Wells Fargo site and did a little research about the company and the job and noticed it said that I had to do an online screen test. I had no idea what that meant and it wouldn't let me do it that day for some reason. So the next day I went back on to the site and took it. It asks a few questions about the job and the position and past experience. Like what would you do if an angry customer confronted you about blah blah blah. Then when I was done it said I could expect a confirmation e mail with a number to call to complete the screening. Once I received it I called and spoke to a woman and she asked me like two of the questions from the test I took only I had to give a few examples. She was friendly and told me I could expect to be contacted soon to see if I will be going in for an interview or not. I waited about 2-3 days and I got an e mail saying I was good to go for a face to face interview and to call and schedule. It was to be that Monday which gave me 3 days to research and practice. I came to Glassdoor actually to see what other people experiences were. And was disappointed to find out how much sales was involved. I almost didnt go to the group interview. But I didn't want to give up so easily. So the day comes. I get there 15 mins early as requested and im like the 3rd person to show. there ended up being about 10-15 people there most looked like they were right out of high school. And spoke like it too. 3 people actually chewed gum the whole time! I mean come on really? It was us and one recruiter. The first thing was we were told we dont have to be nervous and that there were plenty of openings in their many branches so we were not in competition with each other. Then we were asked to state our Name where we were from and which branch we would like to work at. We then looked over a Teller facts sheet where it explained the job and what pay and benefits would be like. After which we were asked why we want to work at Wells Fargo as a teller. Which I hated because you can't really say oh well because I got laid off and im desperate for anything I can get. One of the gum chewers were literally looking at the fact sheet and making up answers on the spot with a lot of ums and likes in between words.The next question was Name a time you had to overcome a challenge. What was the challenge? What did you accomplish? How did it make you feel? and did you get any recognition? The next question was name a time you went above and beyond for a customer? You could tell the recruiter was way more interested in the people who told amazing retail stories. The last question was where do you see yourself in 2-5 years and how does Wells Fargo fit into this? When it was done the recruiter said we did good and we should hear by the end of the week whether we made it to the second interview or not. We left the 2 copies of our resumes with them and that was it. On Friday I received and e-mail basically saying thanks for trying but you don't fit the match. You can reapply in 6 months. Needless to say I wont be reapplying in six months. Thanks for nothing Wells Fargo. I guess even though you had sooo many positions I wasn't good enough for one of them even though I was probably more professional then most of the kids applying. Last I checked the bank teller is supposed to help with basic banking needs like withdraws and deposits and what not. Didn't know it would require me to have worked retail before hand. So be forewarned all you thinking about applying no matter which position it's all sales and you will have to jump through hoops to get to it.,wellsfargo
 What is your greatest accomplishment?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Roughly a week after applying online, I received a phone call for a pre-interview. I was asked about my previous employment and my availability to work Saturdays. I was given a description of the teller position and requirements, then asked if I was still interested. After replying yes, I was invited to a Group Interview. My Group Interview consisted of two recruiters and a total of ten applicants. Everyone received a brochure about the opportunities at Wells Fargo and we were also provided with a packet that contained the agenda. The session started with a DVD about being a Teller at Wells Fargo. After the video, the recruiters start going through the packet and the questions begin. We were seated around a table in a small meeting room and everyone goes The first set of questions were asked together; tell us about yourself, why Wells Fargo and why you would be a good fit as a Teller, and where do you see yourself in five years. The next three questions should be completely answered in the STAR method. We only had to answer two; what is your greatest accomplishment and describe a time you went above and beyond for a customer. Each question had sub-questions like how did it impact you. After the questions were answered, they continue through the rest of the packet which detailed the position and benefits. They also really stress that the Teller position is a sales position and that you have daily goals to meet. At the end, everyone is told that they will receive a phone call or email within ten business days letting them know if they get an interview with a branch. Today was the tenth business day and I have yet to receive any notification.",wellsfargo

The recruiter told us we would be notified over e-mail if we were eligible to make it to the next interview by that Friday. I got nothing until the Tuesday after and it was an e-mail informing me the position had already been filled. Waste of gas, money and time if you ask me. I guess since money is not an object to some of them, the fact I drove two hours for a position that was filled seemed a little ridiculous.

 Why Wells Fargo?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,Initially applied online and got a phone interview which was mostly about gauging my interest in the position. Few days later was invited for a group interview which was of more pressure due to the fact that there were numerous people going for the same position.

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"Interview was very laid back, for a bank they were not overly heavy on techniical questions.

One important technical question was to list the lines in a P&L. Very conservative culture.",wellsfargo
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I was offered a first-round interview after submitting my application through my university's career center. The first round was one 30-minute interview with one representative. She asked me a variety of questions about the company, general accounting, and a brainteaser. My first-round interviewer was curt and not very welcoming. After interviewing, we were asked to fill out a form indicating what divisions of banking we would prefer to work in, (I didn't realize at the time that we weren't interviewing for a specific position). Four weeks later I was contacted by phone letting me know that I had been selected for second-round interviews with Corporate Banking. Because of their schedules, I had to come in over two days. I had four 20-minute one-on-one interviews the first day, and six the following day. Many of the questions were the same between interviewers and it became redundant and tiring fast. (Also, unlike other potential employers they did not offer to reimburse me for transportation expenses or take me out to lunch). It was a smaller office than I expected, it wasn't particularly nice, and neither were quite a few of the interviewers. Unlike other firms that make you feel like they are really interested and invested in you as a potential employee, my experience at Wells Fargo Corporate Banking was rushed and impersonal. The office was quiet and did not seem particularly engaging. About two weeks after the interview, I emailed them to see if I could get an update on their decision and I didn't hear back. At the end of the week, I called and was told that they still hadn't reached a decision. Ultimately, I never heard from them. For a company that prides itself in its customer service, they did not recruit well. I didn't interview with other banks, but I wouldn't recommend Wells Fargo.",wellsfargo

Made no sense to me to ask the same basic questions (Name a time when you were faced with multiple priorities and how did you resolve it? etc...). Then I would be asked a very similar question which I could have used the exact same answer/example as the previous answer. Their questions were kinda strange if you ask me.

 What is your greatest weakness?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"The job was an internal posting but I was required to complete an online application and submit my resume. I submitted a functional resume for this job. Human Resources always does a pre-screening and then will recommend you to the hiring manager if you meet their criteria. At the end of every HR screening I ask what the next steps are, how long it will take for me to hear from someone and if they thought I was a good fit for the job. I always ask if they will recommend me to the hiring manager. In this case, they said yes. It took a couple of weeks to hear back from the hiring manager to set up an interview at another location. I went to the interview and a peer of the hiring manager showed up a few minutes after the interview started. The manager introduced him and said that he was there to observe and maybe ask a few questions. He had a copy of my resume with several items highlighted. She would ask a question, I would begin to answer and then he would interrupt me with something totally unrelated, such as ""I see on your resume that you say you are analytical, what does that word 'analytical' mean to you?"" He did this several times. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be answering his questions or hers. I looked to her for help but she kind of just shrugged her shoulders. It left me wondering if this was their tactic, was it planned, were they trying to get a rise out of me or what? The man was very rude the entire time. I kept my cool and answered all of their questions. I walked out of there very angry and I definitely didn't want the job. It seemed like the hiring manager wasn't a good leader and since I'd also have to have interaction with the other man, I definitely couldn't see myself working with someone so rude.",wellsfargo

While some interviewers asked questions to evaluate my background, most did not ask much of anything. There were several interviews where I was asked one question, then the interviewer spent the majority of the time talking about the program, and then opened it up for my questions. Either they don't know how to conduct interviews, or they just were not prepared.

Currently you must go through a initial screening online perhaps a phone interview until you are invited to a group interview which will than advance you to 1:1 interviews with specific branches.

They will also ask about lapses in time in your resume and if you were employed before and why you left that employment. Since this is a selling position you will be asked to sell a random object to the interviewee. Usually this is to see if you have basic selling skills by giving the features and advantages of the object. My advice if you were given such a exercise would be stay calm, explain the advantages while also if applicable trying to cross-sell maybe another object in the room and than closing with an assumptive sale.",wellsfargo

 When do you think you have really made a difference to someone?   ,Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"The company offers periodic job fairs, where those interested can go and meet with a recruiter, and then they interview the candidates right at the job fair. Though I know that they do group interviews, my interview was one on one with a recruiter. She asked me a variety of questions, including my familiarity with customer service as well as the ability to accurately handle money. She also asked me several other 'personal' questions, such as a moment when I thought I had most helped someone. Many of the other candidates tended not to 'dress up' so much, so I would recommend wearing nice clothes, possibly even a suit, and definitely coming with a resume. The job fairs themselves are not always held on property owned by Wells Fargo, and can drastically vary in location so they are not a good measure of the job environment.

HR offered the standard increment on my current salary and I was happy with it, so didn't negotiate. Got offer letter within 1 week of the salary discussion on a Monday.

There was only one response for my first mail, ""We will share feedback shortly. HR will get in touch with you."" Since that mail they have neglected all my mails and have never responded. I would suggest that if you DO NOT want to waste your day or need feedback for your interview then DO NOT GO FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH THEM. BTW, the questions were quite basic.

The recruiter was clearly not interested in me as a candidate but I still got to go for an in person interview. Following the in person interview it was another period of silence for more than a month after which I was invited to second interview. Following the second interview, there was again no feedback for more than a month. At the end I received an automatic email that they are moving on with other candidates. Seriously Wells Fargo, after phone call, two in person interviews, you can at least take a minute to drop a short personalised email, rather than the automatic email. So much for seeing ""people as a competitive advantage."" I know that the bank's reputation is in shambles following the scandal, but I expected more from them. I was totally wrong. I should also add that in between the interviews all my follow up emails asking for feedback were simply ignored.

So that means, if you are excellent in some core areas, but answer none of the questions for some other subsidiary areas, your chances are gone. And I don't get the logic of telling the feedback of interview after almost 1 hr! I mean, what is the logic of keeping the candidate waiting if he is not to be recommended for next round. What does the HR keep doing for so long. The interview feedback would have been made available by the interviewer immediately. So they can tell the feedback in just about 5-10 minutes of time.

They don't do direct hires with some titles you have to work as a consultant first. It helps to have a contact that can refer you to what agency they use or can refer you to someone who can mentor your career. Apply for any position across the nation, if they like you they will let you train locally and work remotely. Pay close attention to payscale zones, what you think you salary is and what it is can be in reality varies from division to office location.",wellsfargo

 What did you do when a client wasn't happy with their account?

She questioned my resume in front of three other people about my job title and the name of bank before the merger. I knew then it was over, I wanted to walk out, but that wouldn't look professional. I felt if she had a question ,she should of talked to me on the side. I was so embarrassed in front of the others.It was a very demeaning experience. If you are offered the job, be prepared to commit yourself to some very intense training and your personal life will be hold for a long time. Cold calling nights, selling products that you know the client doesn't need just to make a sale. I did this job 13 yrs ago, and now I am not qualified.",wellsfargo
 what sales experience do you have?   ,Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"First of all, VERY long process. From the time i submitted my application to when I received a job offer, just almost two months had gone by. I submitted my application to WF after taking the preliminary skills/intelligence test. If you pass that, you are sent an email with an 800 number to call. Be prepared, when you call this number it is actually a phone interview! So make sure you have a copy of your resume near by so you can refer to it. Basic questions about sales/difficult customers/customer service for the phone interview. After the phone interview, the interviewer told me that no group interview appointments were available at this time and that someone would call email me within the week to schedule the next interview. Almost a MONTH later, I finally get an email saying to schedule my group interview. Extremely long to wait back just to schedule a group interview. I called the 800 number to schedule my group interview for the following week. When I got to the group interview, you are asked to sit in the room where there is various papers about WF and the job for you to look at while you wait for everyone to arrive. Make sure you dress professional. The interview took almost 3 hours and there was 11 other people with me in the interview. The interviewer started off by introducing herself and her career path at WF. Next, we started off the interview by all introducing ourselves and explaining our current job and why you would like to work at WF. A lot of people made the mistake of completely rambling and telling the interviewer and everyone their life story. Lol, so please, remember to keep it informative yet concise. Everyone just raised their hands to be called on. Next question was telling your experience in sales. At each interview you will go through with WF, they will be using the STAR format, so have stories in mind for you to use.. example (""tell me about a time when you ____, what did you learn from it, how did you feel about yourself... blah blah blah"") Then, the question of when you have gone above and beyond for a customer. Again, you need to tell everyone a story here and what you learned from it. But remember not to ramble and take twenty minutes to answer each question. Keep it five minutes, tops! After everyone had answered all the questions, interviewer said that we would hear back by tues. of next week (6 days later). I received a call the next day that I had made it through the next round of interviews. The recruiter said that there were two stores I could pick from to apply for, and I chose the one that offered me more hours and closer to my house. Oh also, in the group interview, the interviewer will ask you where you would most like to work at. So about three days later, I went to the store I was applying at for a 1:1 interview. However, my interview turned out to be a 2:1 interview, with the store manager and the lead teller. The interview lasted about 15-20 minutes. Asked STAR format questions again. It surprised me that the manager asked the SAME three questions that the group interview did. They'll ask you more questions regarding cash handling experience and more ""what would you do if"" questions. The manager said I would be a good fit for the team there and said he would be doing more interviews later in the week but should know his decision by that fri (about four days later). So here comes the part of this whole job hunt thing that made me frustrated. That next fri goes by and I didn't get a phone call that day. So, now it was just a matter of a waiting game. As the days went by, I just figured that I didn't get a job offer and they didn't even bother to call me back saying ""thanks but no thanks."" I got very frustrated because now I have invested a lot of time doing all these interviews and made it to the very last step of the job process, and didn't even get a call or anything. Three weeks later after my 1:1 interview, I get a very unexpected phone call from a WF recruiter saying that she talked to the manager at the store, and they would like to hire me. She then apologized that it took so long, and that the delayed call back was because they were busy. She then told me my salary and how many hours I would be guaranteed each week. Next step was to go get fingerprinted and complete a background check. Pass those, and the job is yours. So for me, like I described it was a very long process. I'm honestly just glad all the interview stuff is behind me, and I finally have the job. Good luck to everyone!",wellsfargo
,No Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"First I want to thank everyone who has put reviews on this website it really helped me!! I applied online after finding the job posting on the company website, within 48 hrs I received an email to call an 800 number for screening. I called the number 2 minutes after receiving it and I had a brief phone interview, the woman asked me to describe a difficult situation dealing with a customer and how I handled it. The person took a couple minutes to write down everything I had said and then she scheduled me for a group interview the following week. I went to the group interview today and it went well (so i think :) there were about 14 of us total. We had to introduce our ""partner"" and basically sell that person to the company. We went around in a group answering 2 questions. We watched a video about the company. Then the recruiter told us more about the company and asked us if we had any questions. She will be contacting us within the next week to either proceed with a 1:1 interview with other branch managers or she will email us a letter declining. You should be yourself and stick out, try to be the first person to answer the questions (anything but last). I hope I get a call back!",wellsfargo

I prepared more for DCFs but they asked about the other 2 methods that I wasnt very familiar with.

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"The interview was with two invesment bankers - one from New York and one from Charlotte. One interviewer was younger and asked all of the technical questions.

Overall the interview wasn't that bad, but I had not adequately prepared for the technical questions. They also asked me which bank has the largest market capitalization in the US - i said B of A, turns out it is Wells Fargo. I don't imagine that helped.",wellsfargo

She informed me that I would be making $10 an hour to start, with frequent opportunities for raises and promotions, which is why I continued the interview process, although I wasn't sure if I really wanted the job. The second interview was at the actual bank where I'd be working if I got the job, with two of the managers, who were also very nice, but they seemed like they didn't like me. They were quick to tell me (when I told them that I preferred full time work) that there were openings at other branches. A little too eager. I mean, I guess honestly, I was just looking for a job to pay the bills and I wasn't sure if I'd like banking all that much. I never got a call back and I think it was just a mutual feeling of ""it's not gonna work"" for both parties.",wellsfargo

One of the things that they made clear was that if I was offered the job, my employment was contingent on referring at 3 customers to banker or convincing them to get a service. To them, I don't think I was aggresive enough. My spirit was too easy going. The main reason I am completely fine with not being offered the job wasthat I am not good at sales. I don't like pressuring anyone to buy anything and I surely would not want the threat of termination over my head if I didn't meet sales goals.",wellsfargo

The experience was negative not because they decided to cancel in the middle but because there was nothing I said in those interviews that they could not have asked during the phone screens. They make a huge deal about their culture and how they get rid of people that are not perfect and yet they have such incompetent hiring managers that don't even know how to do phone screens properly. If there were specific, key requirements for the position, you would think they should probe for that experience during the hours of phone screen they subjected me to and not pretend like they discovered it during the onsite.

 typical recruiting stuff   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,,netflix
 What makes you think that you can apply to this job?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,,netflix
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"SIGH. Netflix recruiting, I had such high hopes for you. The recruiting team & HR is always praised saying how great each and everyone of you all are. The cutthroat environment of only high-performers made me believe that the recruiting process would be some what of a high caliber interview process. I’m sad and disappointed to say that mine wasn’t. After reaching out to a Director directly, I was sent an interview request from a Researcher. This researcher had less than a year of experience. I was hesitant initially but I thought, hey, it’s Netflix, she must be solid to make it at least that long. Gosh, I was so wrong. The call started 5-6 minutes late. She apologized and laid out the outline for the phone conversation (typical layout: going over your background first, recruiter asks you questions and goes over the position, and question time at the end). First couple minutes through the phone call, I can already tell it’s not going well. Was it me? Or was it her? I can definitely let you know that the tone of the Researcher’s voice already made a statement. She wasn’t interested... not even at a bare minimum. Was she forced to screen me? It sure felt like it. The call was VERY rushed. I get that it was for 30 minutes but calling me late, that’s on you. I asked her questions at the end and you know what a recruiter’s pet peeve is? Not answering the darn question. I asked her about the typical req load and offices that I would recruit for. She only answered the latter. So how are you going to judge me as a recruiter and pass on me when you can’t even do a good job screening me? I’m not sure if she was taught about “candidate experience” but here’s my thing. Most candidates take time to research and prepare for the call, even taking time off as needed from work. At the very least, we want to chat to someone who can act interested so the prep and the time is worth it. One Researcher or a Recruiter can leave a bad taste for a candidate. I hope that they can train their newer teammates better because I would hate for anyone to go through what I did.",netflix

After that he had his coordinator set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. 2 weeks later, I had the phone interview.... a disaster! The hiring manager was new and the team he was forming was also new, so once again the clarity and understanding of what he needed/wanted was not there, it was very difficult to relate my experience to something I didn’t know what I was interviewing for. The hiring manager also was short/cut/dry but all over the place! At that point I decided to almost stop the interview as I knew I wouldn’t want to work with someone like that.",netflix

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"The interview process was fairly quick after they contacted me. They actually contacted me for a position different than applied for. The recruiter and the hiring manager were very friendly, but I knew from the start my interview with the hiring manager was off. I was on my game and I felt that my answers were great. It felt like she was unprepared and perhaps disinterested (despite being friendly). When we got off the phone I knew I didn't get it. In hindsight it felt like the hiring manager might have been interviewing for the sake of interviewing and knowing they had another candidate they wanted. Or maybe I said something that was just not in line with the team dynamics. My advice is to study the cultural deck, but also don't beat yourself up if they pass on you.",netflix
 A lot of culture questions   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"At some point you get the culture deck and questions so often that you’ll question if work happens outside of talking about culture.

I left the interview surprised at how little design principles were being followed but empowered by how much the team seemed to be excited about me. I was told I would hear back within a few days and there were favorable hints. And yet, I didn’t hear back in a timely fashion and it was a surprise no.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"The scheduling was quire delayed with tons of communication gaps. I didnt know that my onsite was scheduled until the HM offered a prep call. The only positive thing about the experience was the HM, who was proactive and responsive. During the onsite, the interviewers didn't even introduce themselves beyond providing a name. Some of their statements about modeling seemed questionable. There was a lot of in-depth domain knowledge required for most questions, while it wasn't listed as a requirement. I did poorly with SQL, which was my own fault and also hadn't prepped enough for white-board coding, which led to a no-go.",netflix

" If a Hiring Manager is not returning your emails about a position, what would you do?   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The hiring manager is a huge part of the interview, almost every step of the way. I had one phone interview, followed by a skype interview, followed by a coffee at the office, and then a day at the office where I had four interviews back-to-back, each thirty minutes. One of the interviews on that in-office day was via google hangout. The person who arranged my interview was on the team I was applying for. She was friendly, punctual, and accessible even when she was not in the office. They move fast and the interviews are demanding and intense, likely reflective of the culture, which is great. Use your interviews as a chance to interview the company and its people yourself, and remain honest with yourself at every part of the process. Prepare 3-4 good, well-researched, thoughtful questions for each of your interviewers and don't be afraid to ask them. They're looking for the best of the best because they can, so make sure to remind yourself whenever you are nervous that it is just as much your decision as to whether you want to work there as it is theirs.",netflix

The pluses of interviewing here were getting to visit the Netflix office (though honestly it is unimpressive compared to some other tech companies), some of the people who I met, and that it seems like they have great benefits/comp. The negatives were that some of the people I met on the marketing team weren't very impressive and that I literally had to meet with 10 people in 1 day, which was overwhelming.

Unlike Google or other companies that don't hire people that easily (and consequently don't fire people easily), Netflix seems like the place that will hire people more easily (by looking at the culture fit), because their culture also allows fast turn around with firing employees who are not performing well.

 Have you reviewed the Culture Deck (that's all they care about for some bizarre reason)?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Netflix is the hottest company in Hollywood to work for. Problem is...they know it. So, when they're interviewing you, they like to play games. I was applying for a Coordinator position in their Unscripted Originals department, a position that I was more than qualified for being that I've worked in this space for the past 8 years at numerous production companies and networks. Was emailed on a Friday by one of their recruiters to set a phone interview for that Monday. Therefore, I spent the weekend watching all of their shows, studying the backgrounds of all key Netflix staff members and reviewing the unscripted television marketplace. Needless to say, I was 100% prepared. But, unfortunately, all the recruiter seemed to care about was if I had reviewed their ""culture deck"" and what my thoughts were about it. Every time I tried to display my knowledge of the space and how my unique skill-set can be of value to their company, she kept going back to this culture deck and grilling me about what SPECIFICALLY I liked about the deck – apparently she wanted a more detailed answer. It was very odd, it was like she was testing me to see if I really read this (irrelevant) deck. I’ll be honest, I skimmed through the culture deck, which was by the way, just some generic 100 slide slideshow talking about what Netflix stands for (which was pretty much what any company stands for). I got off the phone and felt really defeated. Seemed like this portion of the interview process was ONLY a test to see if you really read their culture deck. I guess that’s more important than actually being qualified for the position at hand. Honestly, if this is the type of game playing that goes on within their company, then it’s probably a blessing in disguise. Still love their programming though.",netflix

 Why Netflix? Have you read the Culture Memo? Who do you consider is a true Netflix competitor? Do you have the courage to speak up to your boss if you disagree with them?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Every interview process is different.

Second interview is normally with someone at the level you're interviewing with or your hiring manager. You could also be directly into the panel interview. Depending on the level you're interviewing for, you may need to go through a few rounds of interviews. Lower level at assistant and coordinator titles normally go through three interviews. For managers and above you may interview with peers first and higher level people. Netflix does not discuss pay until they make you an offer. but rest assured you will be paid very well. It's all about your level of energy in the interview and if you vibe with your hiring manager. You are rated on a scale of 1 - 4. 1 = would not hire // 2 = leaning towards not hiring // 3 = leaning towards hiring // 4 = would hire.

 What type of new/unique things do you do for recruitment?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Initial phone screen, second round was a google hangout, third round I interviewed with 2 recruiters and the first two people I spoke to. So total in person was 4 folks. Honestly up until that point in the process everything was great. I had a feeling I did not get the role, which in the recruitment business you are familiar with a candidate not being chose, etc (sometimes you are just not the one) BUT what I thought was both rude and demeaning was receiving a thanks but no thanks stating that I wasn't polished enough. Totally unnecessary to say and when you have 4 caucasian people interview a non caucasian that comment even hints at other underlying motives.",netflix

 Why do you want work for Netflix/this position?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,First I applied online through their site. I received an email a week by a recruiter later notifying me that they were interested and to set up a time for a phone interview.,netflix
,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"Had an employee referral and also applied online. After about a week or two I received an email from a recruiter to schedule a phone call. We spoke on the phone for about 30 minutes. She was very thorough with her questions and definitely seemed to understand the position, the requirements and the company very well. She then emailed me the same day to schedule another phone interview with the department head. That interview went even better. Again was asked a lot of the same questions but this time the interviewer talked a lot more and was very inviting so we had a great 30 minute phone call. A day or two later I was asked to come in for an in person interview. I met with 4 people: a different recruiter (not from my phone interview), the department head, another supervisor from the department and someone who works in a department that I would be working closely with. Each interview was scheduled for 30 minutes. Each one asked the same questions I had already been asked in both my phone interviews. It was pretty boring and very repetitive. I felt like even if we didn't have 30 minutes of conversation to be had they made sure to stick around the full 30 minutes. The recruiter was much more focused on the company culture, the others a bit more on the actual department and position. The company culture and their 100+ page deck is a bit much. I followed up a few days later via email and one week after my interview received a voicemail saying that they went with someone else. I was 90% sure I was going to get the job since I had gotten so far in the interview process, had an employee referral and was totally confident I could handle the work efficiently.

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"3 phone interviews - one HR and two technical. An onsite loop including two parts: first part is 4 technical and 1 HR and if the feedback is positive you move to the second part which is to meet with two directors. Overall the interview experience was great, and I met smart people that I would have enjoyed working with (including the team's manager). I did well on the technical part and met with the two directors. The first was an HR director and the second was the person who would have been my skip level. I noticed that the interaction with him was the least positive from all the people I've met on that day. It seemed as if he came into the meeting with some form of negative bias. Two days later I was informed that I was not fit for the role. The team's manager sent me feedback. I was very happy about this because usually companies refrain from giving candidates direct feedback. Based on the feedback I'm certain that the meeting with the last director cost me the job. This is unfortunate, because Netflix seems to be a great company to work for, and the people are great. My biggest tip is that when you interview, make sure to stay focused all the way through. Every interview counts - including the last two director interviews which seem to be more easy going but are crucial just the same. Another important tip that I received feedback on is to show passion and enthusiasm about the company and about the role. They are looking for people who are really ""into"" the domain the company is in and in the specific domain of the role. If you don't show enthusiasm they'll not hire you!",netflix

I was sent an email to complete which covered typing, tech knowledge, and grammer. The phone interview is more of a general Q&A about work experience and how you respond to customers. When you are speaking to the recruiter make sure to use ""the STAR method"" when responding to behavior based questions. I passed the first step in the process. They invited me out to an interview at the call center. Note the interview really does take 2 hours. The first part of the interview you listen to other agents on the phone. After that you pull into a meeting room and do group role playing. After that I did another interview one on one. One of the interview questions was my attendance record. When I said I was only late twice in the last year the interviewer didn't like the answer. I told him that it was because of the snow. (Keep in mind I live in Utah) he looked dumbfounded.

Maybe it's me, but I'm confident I'm qualified for the positions I was up for and had a good phone call. I work with Netflix from another company, and have colleagues who work there. I know the culture, and am on the receiving end of their business relations. I studied the culture deck, and had what I thought to be good phone interviews both times. I asked solid questions. I listened to them and provided a good account of my background. However, it seems as if they have a set of guidelines that are kind of a 'gotcha"" tactic to weed people out which was really unfair. I only know this because when I was told they were not going to continue with me, I asked for feedback, and their answer was odd. For instance, I told them I enjoyed being a leader in my position, to have a proactive stance and to lead by example. They took it to mean that I wanted to have a say in organizational decisions...??!! What? That was not what I said. That is not what I would want, nor would that even be in my purview for discussion. I'm an Assistant. I felt my words were misinterpreted or twisted. It's obvious I'm not the type for them, and honestly - as much as I respect this company and its creative content - I'm happy to work with them from another company.

I had a phone interview with the recruiter, and then a video interview with the same recruiter about 3 weeks later. Was brought in for an in-person interview with one member of the PR team and the recruiter about a week after the video interview. The team member seemed disinterested in being in the interview from the moment they walked into the room, and seemed irritated anytime I tried to elaborate on an answer to one of their questions. That interview lasted 10 minutes at most; no further interviews took place, and no offer was extended.",netflix

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,A friend/current employee submitted my resume. I was contacted by their recruiter and scheduled a phone interview with her. She recommended reviewing their strategy and culture presentation slides. Phone interview with the recruiter went well and I scheduled a video conference interview with the hiring manager. The video conference lasted about 30 minutes and we went over my experience and skills. The manager confirmed he'd like to have me come in for an in-person interview. I spent 2.5 hours meeting with the team in pairs both in person and over video conference. I met with the recruiter and hiring manager once more and that concluded the interview process.,netflix

Also only apply if you have empathy and oooh do not be callcenter-y! although you are applying to work at a call center. Although I have never worked at a call center..

 Implement this relatively big framework in a short time period especially given that I've got a full time job as it is.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied for the role online as I figured I've got a good background for it. Indeed, I got an email from a recruiter who called me afterwards and set me up with a phone screen. Both phone screens were very pleasant and professional. I was asked a lot of questions about my background and some general multimedia programming related questions which were fair all in all. After a few days I was asked to build a small framework which can show my coding skills and understanding of the subject. The suggested deadline was 6 days afterwards. I was happy to take the project however due to a stressful project I had at my job I asked for an extension. To which I was answered: ""Ok, but please take into account that we're interviewing other candidates at the same time and we might progress with them"". I gave it my best efforts and put anywhere from 15-20 hours into building and testing my solution and was able to submit it one day before the suggested deadline. According to my understanding the hiring manager was happy with my implementation as a recruiter called me in order to coordinate an in person interview day and schedule flights and accommodation for the trip. Needless to say I was happy when I received the suggested itinerary. However, 10 minutes after receiving the email I received a phone call from the recruiter who told me that while the team would be happy to meet me, they are already in advanced stages with an another candidate so it wouldn't be a good use of my time to make the trip. I just felt rather uneasy since I totally played by Netflix's rules and despite that I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance eventually. I feel that the hiring process was unprofessional and unethical in my case.",netflix

 It was in the form of two role plays   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,It was a different kind of interview which was good the only problem was if you didn't know someone already working there you were out of luck. You can totally tell they go by referrals not by skills. About 4 people who did great still didn't get a offer because we didn't know people working there.

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"First phone screen was with hiring manager, which went well. Second call was with recruiter, the ""Netflix Culture Deck"" came up in conversation several times. Third was a technical phone screen focusing on SQL skills. Good knowledge of analytic functions, such as LAG() and ROW_NUMBER() covers most everything. Toughest question was to build a basic collaborative filter, which is possible by joining a table on itself a couple of times with specialized ON and WHERE clauses. Onsite interviews were split between technical and developing metrics around product usage and quality. Technical was more with analytic functions, and one question that required a recursive select statement (possible in Terradata, but I didn't know it). Basic Python whiteboarding with list comprehension and such was also in the mix. I got good feedback, but they went with someone else.",netflix

After a month, a phone interviewed was scheduled with the recruiter then the next day I had a phone interview with a manager. Another month later I was finally scheduled for an in person interview. I met with 4 different people. I felt that most interviewers were very cold towards me, seemed bored, and asked me questions that didn't even relate the position. The last interviewer was probably the one of the rudest person I've ever met. She didn't even make eye contact with me, kept asking me questions that were not even related to the position and had such a sarcastic attitude after I responded to each one of her questions.

The tech assessment was just to see how well you could navigate on their search engine and as long as you passed the assessment you would get to do a small role play with the recruiter. If you pass the role play you will be asked to schedule a second and final interview. Final interview was also a group interview where we watched a slide show about netflix and then had to answer two role play scenarios.

You are taken to a room and are given a computer test; WPM type of things. My one on one was less than 5 minutes and he just asked why Netflix? I was then sent off to round two. Another computer test where you asked to navigate and find things on the Netflix website. Your job as a rep is that website. EVERY single problem you can encounter is answered in that HELP CENTER.

The recruiter was on speaker phone and mumbled the entire time, rushing through the questions. When I politely asked her if she could turn off the speaker phone, she became terse and annoyed. I could tell the recruiter was very distracted.

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online and heard from a Netflix recruiter via e-mail about a week later. We scheduled a time to talk on the phone and in the meantime I was instructed to read the lengthy culture deck. The recruiter phone convo was pretty generic and I felt like he spoke really fast and didn't himself grasp the position at hand, but it overall went well. Next I had a phone call with the two department heads. That was supposed to last about half an hour, but was only about 15 minutes. It was in this conversation I was able to get a better grasp of the position and what they were looking for, while discussing my skill set and how it complements the job at hand. After following up, I was asked to provide times I would be available for an in-person interview. I was scheduled to meet with 4 people for 30 minutes each, the last of which was a recruiter up in Los Gatos, so we did a video conference. The interview went the full 2 hours which is kind of exhausting. Overall, I felt it went well and got along with everyone and seemed to be anticipating what they needed. One of the issues seemed to be that Netflix prides itself on not a lot of ""process"" and this position was going to be very process-driven. They expressed that they were taking their time looking because it was a new position and they wanted to find the exactly right person for the position and to fit in personality-wise. I guess I was not that person because I heard back from a Netflix recruiter about 3 days later that although I ""had positive feedback, it's unfortunately not going to a be quite the perfect match for the role that we have today.""",netflix

First of all, the recruiter was based out of state. He contacted me on my secondary phone number instead of my main line and the call came late. I had a hard time understanding him to begin with as I think English was his second language. I asked a few questions myself which he answered irrelevantly. The questions were purely experience based and nothing out of the ordinary but I could tell he wasn't an experienced recruiter and didn't seem passionate about the job as most at reputable, big companies don't seem like they're ticking off questions on a checklist but keep the conversation flowing naturally, but geared towards a purpose. I thought to myself the entire time, I wouldn't want to work for this company if these are the values they stand for.

She scheduled a phone interview for the next day which lasted about 20 mins. Basic questions such as tell me about yourself, Why netflix? And customer service experience. At the end of the phone interview, I was invited to the interactive group interview in which we had 8 candidates. First we took a tour of the office then we met up with 2 recruiters, 2 supervisors, and 1 manager. It is all based off a PowerPoint slide which was pretty cool and the interview was more of a discussion between everyone. Just be prepared to tell your customer service stories during this time. After, we changed rooms to where there was computers. This began the role playing. Typical customer service role playing, then you have to act as if you are a Netflix employee. Super fun yet nerve-racking at the same time! I'd say that was the hardest part but you get to use the computer in front of you to find your answers of course. After that, you get to shadow and watch current reps answer a few calls. They then walk you to the door and thats it! Recruiter called the next day offering me the job!",netflix

 No difficult questions   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,Interview started with a phone screening which lasted 20 minutes and I was asked to come for an interactive interview the following week.I showed up for the interactive interview and there were around five other candidates.We were given a tour of the office and then led to the conference room to meet two HR folks and two other managers.We were individually asked basic customer service related questions and shown a PowerPoint presentation about Netflix.They kept stressing about the importance of being empathetic and understanding the customers.We all agreed and I thought the interactive part went well.Next we were given certain scenarios and we had to role play which was a bit nerve racking but fine.Then there was a computer test on how to find the best solutions for customers calling with general problems and then a written test.After that we shadowed a Netflix customer service rep and listened in on a call.I thought I had done well enough to be hired.Next we were walked to the door and told we would receive an email with a yes or no answer.I waited 3 days to hear back but got no response (these are the same people who stressed about the importance of customer service...what a joke) so I decided to email the recruiter and then got a reply saying they decided not to hire me since my background was not what they were looking for.My question is did they not know my background from my resume and I have been in a customer service role in almost every job I have done.How hard is it to take a call from a customer.This is not rocket science and does not require any specialized skill.Anyone can do this job. Why did they call me for an interview if my background was not what they were looking for.All my information was in my resume which they had.I really was unhappy with the end result.

My interview schedule consisted of 5 interviews back-to-back with various members of the team I would have worked on as well as the hiring manager (VP) and his boss (Sr. VP). Everyone I met with was friendly, smart and fair. The interviews were not overly difficult if you are qualified for the position and have been through a competency-based interview approach before. One portion of the interview process involved a case-study approach where the questions got progressively harder as the hypothetical scenario unfolded. I felt that each interviewer answered any questions that I asked honestly. At the end of the 5 interviews I had a final interview with the CMO (who has since moved on from Netflix), so the first 5 must have gone well enough for serious consideration. This was also a positive experience. In the end, I had no desire to take the job they ultimately wanted to hire me for - nor did they like me for the job I did want. We left with a mutual understanding that it wasn't a good fit. I was not extended an offer but was left with a lot of respect for the folks I spoke with.",netflix

She didn't make it clear that we were scheduling a phone interview until the end of the conversation. The next day at the appointed time, I received the call and the interview began. It was a little strange. It was as if she was just reading my resume from the bottom up and asked if I liked the job and why I left. There was hardly any mention of my relevant skills or attitudes towards a call center environment, two things the application placed emphasis on. At the end I was told I would either receive a phone call or an email about the next step. I got off the phone feeling very unsatisfied. We spent more time talking about why I left a job in 2004 than anything actually relevant. Perhaps there is a method behind the madness, who knows.",netflix

,Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied online and got a phone call from a recruiter two days later. I was scheduled for an hour interview with the same HR person a few days later. The interview went very well. The interesting thing was that the recruiter seemed to know a lot about the business and asked me some tough questions which made the process interesting. I got a call back the same day and had another interviewed scheduled with the hiring manager for a few days later. That interview was pretty simple with basic skills discussion and a brief overview of the job/company. The hiring manager said immediately after the interview that I would be called in for an inperson interview. I was scheduled for an all day interview for the next week. The whole in person experience was a bit odd from the minute I arrived at the location in Los Gatos. It was 8am and felt like 4pm on a Sunday - no one to be found around. The whole place felt deserted. There was only one receptionist in the whole building. I was escorted to the room I was supposed to interview in by the hiring manager who was first in line to interview me. I got to ask many questions during that interview which I appreciated. The next interview was with a potential colleague in the same team. She asked a few case questitons. She did not feel very happy with her position or the manager when I asked her a few questions about how she felt working there. The third interview was a full hour of consulting style case study. The three interviews after that was easy and involved general business questions (two of these were with HR). My last interview for the day was with a C level exec and was brutal. Pretty intimidating but apprently I did well as I got offered the job five days after the in person interviews. They do referral checks and do actually call your references. Make sure to have your references prepare a list of strengths and weaknesses. After the reference checks were completed the recruiter called me for another meeting which I thought was the second round of in person interviews. It was not an interview day though. They made the offer to me in person in the Los Gatos office.,netflix
 General questions about how you worked within a team - they have specific personality requirements that they're looking for   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Phone interview was standard.

It was extremely thorough, although overwhelming at times, and they freely admitted that they often fired employees who weren't constantly putting in extra effort. Definitely worth it to ask them the breakdown of the team in detail - job titles mean very little at Netflix, as your job responsibilities are constantly shifting, and they rarely do title promotions.",netflix

We scheduled a phone interview in which the interviewer asked basic questions about my experience and tried to get a fee for my personality. Then we did two rounds of scenario role playing which were pretty simple and straightforward. When we were finished she asked me to come in for a group ""Interactive Interview"" and gave me some possible times. They ask you to come in 15 minutes early, so I showed up about 20 minutes before the start time. There wasn't actually a reason to be early, maybe they have a problem with people being late or something. But, we (the group of us waiting to be interviewed) sat and chatted while we waited. It was all very casual and laid back. First they gave us a tour through the call center which is much more open and inviting than most others I've seen. Then we went into a back room where we were pitched scenarios (we gave individual answers in the group setting) and asked how we would respond. Then we listened to actual calls and were called on for similar answers. The final part of the interview consists of a computer test.

This was where I found it interesting. This ""interactive"" group interview was supposed to be comprised of role playing, which sounds silly and childish to many people, but I thrive on that due to my theater and video production background. However, this role playing consisted of listening to recorded calls, then everyone responding to a few phrases after it had stopped. They stressed to the group to NOT try and come up with a solution as we wouldn't know the policies on correct solutions until after training so really if you go to this training, listen to one of these calls and say, ""I'm sorry to hear that you are having trouble. I would be frustrated too. We value your business. Lets see what we can do."" Bam, youve got the job. Oh, and there was a computer literacy test, that was supposed to test how well you can navigate around their website.

I went through all the interviews ranging from the operations manager, HR, and finally with the regional manager. They seemed to like me, the interviews went well until I asked a question to all of them. I told them the that the CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings made a comment in the Wall Street Journal in July addressing their shareholders, that Netflix plans to be 100 percent operation in 5-7 years with online streaming and will be getting out of DVD copies all together. So I asked all the interviewers if this is true what will become of operations personnel in that time frame. Well, they all became very defensive stutttering that there will always be a need for DVD copies blah blah blah. They all became very irate with the question. I was very surprised since I was asking a question based on a factual statement by the owner of the company. They ended up not offering me the job and when I asked the recruiter why he said that they all felt I would not be a team player. He stated the regional manager felt that my devotion to the corporate mission would be in question. Huh? All I asked was what they thought of the CEO's comment and how it would impact operations personnel in 5-7 years. Of course this implies that there might be a 70 percent reduction in their workforce if they go to online straming forcing most of their operations hubs to shutdown. What a joke!

The next round was another one-on-one with a team member who again quizzed me on some engineering fundamentals. Similar to the first call he was typing everything I said and it felt like the questions were from a standard list that they chose from including the follow-up questions.

Scheduled a 30min video interview with the engineering manager who seemed to care about my previous experiences that related to the position and how I thought I could fit in. The interview was completely nontechnical. It felt more like a casual conversation and was kept fairly unstructured as the highlights of the interview didn’t revolve around the initial “interview questions” I was asked, but where I took them in the conversation. I found it helpful to review my resume experiences prior so I could “quick draw” specific examples from my projects on the fly that demonstrated how I think and showed my ability to technically fit into the position without having to be explicitly asked.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Recruiter contacted me followed by call with hiring manager and 2 phone screens with coding in an editor which went ""very well!"" according to feedback, then onsite. Interviewed for a more junior position. For the onsite, you will have to prepare a power point presentation on some technical achievement or project that solves a critical problem. If you aren't the type of person to do side projects or if you can't quickly whip up something impressive, just quit here and save your time. Apparently it's also a code review, which wasn't explicitly revealed to me, and my presentation was torn to shreds in a way that I personally thought was leaning toward unprofessional and, quite frankly, unkind. There's a way to criticize someone's work without interrupting them and making the room awkward. So if you share any code, make sure it's perfectly optimized. Better yet, just be perfect. I'd say this was overall a time-consuming process that requires a lot of at-home preparation. I left Tesla feeling pretty defeated and like our values didn't align. Otherwise, I'd say it's a fair process if you're the type of person who immerses them-self in projects or are one of those Tesla/Elon fangirl/boy types; that's probably who they want to hire anyway.",tesla

This took more than 2 weeks to arrange. The onsite interviews consisted of 5 or 6 interviews 30-60mins a piece. Half of the interviewers focused on case questions and half on behavioral. The case questions were poorly constructed. At one point I was asked if I brought a computer with me....(seriously? Mention it in before the interview).

 Why Tesla?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Was called on the phone from a recruiter/screener from corporate who ran down the position details and asked me questions about my experience. Her previous call went long, so she ended up calling me 15 minutes late into the 30 minute time slot.

Having gone through the interview process for lesser positions within Tesla a few months prior, I let her know my history with the application process to best utilize our time together. After giving her my previous employment history and interview history, she said she thought I would be a great fit based on my experience and passion for the electric future.

It's been 2 months and haven't heard back from the recruiter or anyone at Tesla after sending her 3 follow up emails.

 General design questions about an autonomous car project from school   ,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Got call from the recruiter through an employee referral. Had a short talk and explained to him my background and later he send me the job description of ""Staff Firmware Engineer"". I already took the coding challenge couple of weeks earlier for another Tesla Firmware position, so he let me skip the coding challenge. Then he setup a phone interview with the Director of the team. The interview was scheduled for 10AM but right before that, the recruiter emailed me and rescheduled it for 530PM in the evening. 530PM passed but no one called and finally got the call at around 615PM. The person was in a rush but had a quick conversation. A week later after poking the recruiter, he setup me up with an informal 1 hour long onsite interview with the team. It was 3 different Managers from Tesla Energy team who interviewed me together and talked about very general subjects regarding my past projects and some design basics. One of them was really cool, I could see him putting a lot of thoughts before asking me any question and also paying attention to what I am saying. The 2nd person was ok and was asking me questions as I went along. The third one somehow gave me a very weird vibe and I didn't like his attitude too much. After the interview I reached out to the recruiter and by that time I had an offer from one of their competitor. At that time the recruiter told me that the position available is not Staff but a general ""Firmware Engineer"". The fact that I already had 5+ years of Firmware experience and another offer from a competitor for a Staff position so I declined Tesla and moved on. Honestly I am a bit surprised as to how the recruiter first shared a Staff position's job description and later said they want to move forward as just a ""Firmware Engineer"" and not even a Senior position. Personally I didn't expect it from a company like Tesla.",tesla

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Ridiculously long process multiple phone screens, multiple in person interviews concluded with a 3 person panel interview by seemingly uninterested managers. Multiple recruiters responsible for sending emails and interview confirmations makes communication aggravating. Throughout my process I met and interviewed with 5 different managers across 3 departments, all the same with the exception of two who were far more down to earth and less egotistical. Little to know interest in my background or skills attained through my previous careers, all 3 interviewers displayed cynical expressions at times during my responses to questions. My perception was they couldn't appreciate that I could relate to what they called ""challenges"" for their respected departments. They pushed the start up mentality and the challenges that come with that but didn't seem to care that my last occupation was with a fast growing start up. Overall this leaves me with some disdain for Tesla, all my interactions with employees via phone or in person at Tesla locations everyone comes across very average but managers will tell you otherwise. During my tour of a service center I saw technicians eating donuts while working on cars, service concierge conversing in groups huddled around cell phones and service advisors scrolling the internet between customers who are more than willing to point you in the right direction and never leave their chair.",tesla

 Recite your resume by heart   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Recruiter contacted within 1 day after applying. This is where the good news ends. I was sent a “take-home quiz” that they ask of all engineers, and that supposedly Elon Musk reviews. When I asked to speak with the hiring manager first, they dropped the quiz requirements because “you are too senior anyway”. OK, the hiring manager didn’t have time to speak by phone so he asked for an on-site. When I came to the HQ, it took about 20 minutes to park because the valets were clueless and I circled the building twice before just parking somewhere, disregarding the signs since I was already running late. When I checked in, the recruiter who was supposed to greet me was 10 minutes late, apologized that he had a busy day, and said that the hiring manager would come down to pick me up. OK... The hiring manager comes down, the guy is clearly under a lot of stress, wasn’t friendly at all. No small talk, no usual offer of water/tea/coffee, he took me into a conference room and asked to “voice over the resume”. I asked if there were any specific questions he wanted to explore, but he just wanted me to recite my resume going all the way back to college (I have over 20 years experience after college). He then said that their culture is very intense, and that Elon can fire folks after just one bad conversation. I don’t know why anyone would want to work in this environment... They don’t even have that many perks and from what I hear they don’t pay very well either. The only perk is that you get to test-drive a Tesla occasionally. Big deal... I cut the interview short and said it was clearly not a fit for me.",tesla

I had almost thrown in the towel on Tesla. Then I was finally passed off to a second recruiter with a schedule open enough to allow me to phone interview without having to take time off my job. She was friendly and thorough and very informative. Given the hoops I had jumped through she was willing to schedule my 2nd interview out a bit. The 2nd interview was online via video.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through Tesla's online portal with my resume and a cover letter. Soon afterwards a recruiter reached out. He wanted to schedule a talk about 1 hour from sending the email, which was a fast turnaround but I obliged. He then missed our call and the emailed to reschedule to an hour later, which he ALSO missed, without sending an email to notify me that he would be missing it. We then rescheduled to the next day, when he called me about 20 minutes late. The interview itself went fine - he asked fairly standard behavioral questions, although about halfway through we started discussing things that were way off topic - sports, travel, etc. To make sure that I was a good fit, after the interview he asked for me to go line by line on the job requirements and write why I met the requirement. After emailing the recruiter this information, he completely ghosted me - no response despite 3 followup emails. Would have been nice to at least send a rejection email. Overall a pretty terrible first impression of Tesla.",tesla
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I selected a specific day and time for a phone interview and the recruiter/interviewer called 10 minutes after the time frame! After numerous attempts to contact the recruiter and also the recruiter department, I was ignored and no one reached out for a reschedule. I also noticed that the position I had applied for was suddenly updated and not available as an active application, I take this as a neglected and denied application. I guess the recruiters are exempt from their flaws while still not even giving applicants a chance to reschedule... so much for my opportunity to contribute my resources and my chance of joining Tesla ;(",tesla

Afer about 45min I was passed along to the direct manager who I video conferenced in on my own device...thankfully I brought headphones and had decent service.

" They had a test that, if i had been recently out of school i probably would have done better. Though being in the field for several years, they are not things that are actually used in the real world, or if they are, they are used rarely, and you look them up when you encounter them.   ",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"My interview process was apparently a little different due to me being on the other side of the country. I had two phone interviews with recruiters from the company, then i was invited to a local interview event. I had never felt as good as i had interviewing with the people i met there, they were all intelligent easy to get along with, and driven. The feedback i had gotten was that they needed people with my skill set, and i really got along with everyone well. I was told usually interviewees go through many more people, though, I only had to interview with 4 different people on the first round. When i got to the later rounds, they indicated they wanted me to take a job as a mechanical engineer. Which is odd, as im an electrical engineer. It seems to me that that trying to shift people from their disciplines does not serve them, or the prospective employee. It smells of desperation to get people in the door, which seems to fall in line with what ive read in reviews of the job. The last correspondence i had with them, they made condescending remarks about me contacting them ""when im serious about a job"". Given they wanted me to change disciplines, this seems rather pretentious, and raises major flags with me, as such i decided to not contact them back. I get feeling the company is demanding, i was told you work 7 days a week, and the pay is low for the valley. the culture appears to be friendly, and casual, but demanding. I do, as i indicated, have serious concerns about the longevity issues, given the companies propensity to bait and switch, and overworking, and underpaying employees.",tesla

" Training style, leadership philosophy, instructional design background   ",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was really thrilled to get an interview with Tesla. As a big tech fan, naturally they are the Apple equivalent of what's happening with electric vehicles at the moment. While I had originally applied to a different (but related) position, I was happy to move forward with the one the recruiter had contacted me for. Speaking of which, the recruiter was so friendly and I felt like we could have been friends. Culture definitely boded well initially, and that same theme rang true for the rest of the interview process. After speaking with the Recruiter, I had another phone screen with the other person currently in the role, and then that person's manager. That same day as the manager, I had a video interview with the director. I really felt like I vibed with the team, and had a good time speaking to each of them. Very unique for an interview experience! The final step was to put together a short training module, only 10 minutes long, and facilitate it over another video interview with the same group and some additions. I felt like I put together a really robust module for it only being 10 minutes, and of course it's nerve wracking to not only facilitate over the internet, but also when it's a job interview. Unfortunately, the feedback on the module wasn't positive, and I get that. I was disappointed in myself for not sticking what seemed to be a good landing, and appreciated the feedback. The recruiter was excellent and volunteered to pass my resume around to a few other hiring teams, which is way above and beyond what you expect from a recruiter in this very competitive landscape. I'd love to work there, and had a great time getting to know the people, and hope it works out for the better in the future. The process was just finishing up as the news came out about the release of quite a few people, and that did not seem to reflect on their process, culture, or speed.

The exam was timed and done entirely online...which I did, within a reasonable amount of time. I sent the exam and NEVER received any follow up. I waited and followed up myself and never received any further communication. So after being told that I was an ""ideal"" candidate, I was just left in the dark. I don't feel that my performance on the practical exam could have been that bad, and although there were a few questions that I could not answer (which I already told the hiring manager that I did not have experience with prior to the test, and they seemed fine with it), I was able to answer everything else that I did have experience with.

Mechanical, electrical, software, hardware, manufacturing, design, thermodynamics, etc. Yes! It's that varied. And most of it (not all) is not even related to what the job description says. You might say ""well, they just want to test how diverse is your knowledge."" But hey, when a candidate has already spent 5+ months with you answering questions directly related to the position, why would you expect him to know answers to all the unrelated branches of engineering science when you call him on-site for what is supposed to be the ""last round"". I mean, when it is the last round, shouldn't you be testing the candidate for exactly the skills he/she needs to have to be the right fit for the role? Well, whatever. I hope they find a genius they are looking for. From what I can say, it won't be someone who is a fresher and an entry-level candidate without any formal industry experience.

This interview didn't go as well, the on-site recruiting manager seemed really uninterested in everything I was saying and the interview only lasted 10 minutes. I followed up with the first person I interviewed with and she told me their focus had shifted and that I was no longer being considered for the position. I assume this was just a nice way of saying they didn't think I had enough industrial maintenance experience (I am pretty young) yet. I would imagine that if you have more than 3 or 4 years of industrial maintenance experience you would have no problem getting this job because they're hiring from the ground up.",tesla

 Why Tesla?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Took a while to schedule the interview in the first place, but after that the interviewer spent barely 8-9 minutes with me. They barely asked me any questions (some weren't even relevant to the position), and at some point I felt like I was asking more questions than they were. It was at the point where I had to ask ""That's it? Are you sure you don't need more information or have more questions to ask?"". After being told I'll hear back soon, but didn't, I followed up and got a standard reply the next few hours saying basically ""Thanks, but we chose someone who was already far along in the process"". So I wasn't really given a fair chance and they had already made their mind up, but honestly that's alright and that's life. I know I'll get somewhere someday.

" In your current/previous work environment, what has been the hardest thing for you to do?   ",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"In a single day, I interviewed with a total of seven people. Two people at a time and then one person at the very end. In total, I was at Tesla for four hours. It's great that they include potential coworkers as part of the interview process, but from my experience as a hiring manager, although group cohesion is very important, it is also vital to hire people that are well qualified and can get the work done. What shocked me most was that a couple of the individuals that were interviewing me seemed like they should never have been hired in the first place. As a supervisor, their competency level seemed a bit questionable. (This is not to put down Tesla Motors or the caliber of its employees, but this is solely based on my experience. I'm not upset that I didn't get the job, in fact, it worked out best that I didn't as I ended up branching out on my own doing consulting work.)",tesla

After passing the phone screen was scheduled to have an in-store interview with the Regional Sales Manager. This was then followed through with several phone screens, HR Director, Senior Marketing Director and Director of Sales. At this point in the process I was told that there would be one more final interview and that was scheduled at the Fremont Factory with the President of Sales and HR Director. Once the interview concluded this was where all contact fell out. Even after being told throughout the process the next steps at the end of each interview there was no contact from either the recruiter nor HR as to next steps beyond the final interview with President of Sales. Highly unprofessional interview process that is long and drawn out for no particular reason. When you as an applicant are spending several months in the interview process as a general rule you should at least receive some contact as to whether you were selected or not. However, it seems this is the norm with Tesla and you are just another applicant to them that once they are done their decision making they don't bother to respond back to your follow up. Not a company that I would want to work for even if an offer was made at this point based on their process.",tesla

What impact did you make at your previous job that you are most proud of?   ,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"The first interview was a good experience. The second experience was rather bad. University recruiter was friendly at first and got gradually cold/rude. Mentioned my previous experience could be an achilles heel for the role, because I had worked in places that were too focused on standards...then they said that Tesla was all about flexibility. So, the recruiter presumed that because I worked in such environment I won't be able to succeed in Tesla's. When I asked them how the interns were going to be evaluated, they said that they would evaluate the interns according to the standards set, the performance, etc. So there ARE standards and processes at Tesla. Finally, the recruiter seemed upset I had not seen the videos on FB about the intern experience; even though I had done other research to learn about the culture at Tesla. In general, this person was not warm and even their answer of why they chose to work at Tesla ( being the 4th recruiter, do something completely new, start a a blank canvas) did not match with how they grilled me on all the reasons why I should want to work for Tesla.

The other 5 engineers were very enjoyable and the overall experience was good, however they said they would move forward with another candidate.",tesla

 Where do you see yourself in 5 years.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,4x interviews: They just wanted to hear that I'll never try to go to another department and that I am in love with Tesla. Many times they tried to get me to say I'm looking to go somewhere else or get a new job. I said that I might eventually want to look into Human Resource jobs at Tesla Motors and for two days I was on the phone trying to convince them that I didn't mean it.

 Nothing out of the ordinary.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied for a job at Tesla a few years ago and they email/called me based on my resume in the database. I was impressed that they actually sourced from older applications. It was at this point that things turned into typical recruiting. We exchanged a few emails set up and conducted a phone screen, discussed next steps including additional interviews. After a few weeks and a few follow ups with the recruiter there was nothing but radio silence. Tesla is an incredible brand but not the best reputation for how it treats it's employees (and I guess candidates). We've reached a point in time where recruiting needs to get with the times and realize it's a sales and customer service function. Recruiters need to respond, be honest, and respect candidates time. ""No response"" is no longer acceptable. I wish them all the luck but not have a very different perspective on the company.",tesla

" There were no difficult or unexpected questions, everything was pretty straight forward.   ",No Offer,,,"I was contacted via LinkedIn by a 3rd party (they did not work for Tesla) recruiter who inquired if I would be interested in a controls engineer position with Tesla Motors. I replied within the same day with my resume as requested and scheduled a brief phone interview the next day. The phone interview was somewhat challenging as I had to escape from a hectic work schedule momentarily with little time to review. The questions were mainly regarding my previous experience. One of the questions involved describing a challenging problem at a previous employer and covering all aspects of how I solved it. I was asked what my current salary was and was told that they needed this information so they could determine if ""they could afford me"". Recruiter was professional in all communications. After the phone interview, I was given a name of a recruiter who would potentially call me within a few days. I also promptly received a follow up email with a job description and links for Tesla including YouTube videos for what I could assume was for the purpose of company branding. Some of the videos had been removed due to TOS (I believe one was a Discovery Channel Giga Factory video). Otherwise, I immersed myself in Tesla for the following days. 12 days later in the morning I got a somewhat unexpected call from Tesla's recruiter, as no specific time was set. The recruiter's questions were somewhat basic: why would you want to work for Tesla, what do you know about Tesla , etc. (I made the mistake of calling the ""Store"" a dealership..oops). Recruiter was friendly and upbeat and discussed a further interview with a supervisor in the controls engineering department. I promptly received a follow up email with the same job description and Tesla branding links. We scheduled the second phone interview with the supervisor for later that day. I received a call at the scheduled time and asked questions / discussed the position and answered several questions regarding my previous experience for 15-20 minutes. The interviewer was professional and pleasant to speak with. The call ended with the interviewer stating the he would talk to another engineering supervisor to see ""if they had any open positions for me"". I looked forward to hearing back but heard nothing for 10-12 days after which I followed up with Tesla's recruiter via email but I received no response. One week after that, I followed up with the 3rd party recruiter who promptly replied that they would follow up with Tesla. I received no response after that.

After that was accepted they scheduled a phone interview with someone from the firmware engineering department. The interview was basically going over my resume asking details.

 Tell me about a time when you lead an aggressive cost reduction activity?   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"The process started with 2 brief phone interviews with Human Resources. These interviews included a review of my resume and a discussion about what type of position I am looking for. A series of phone interviews at the Engineering Director level followed. These interviews were also focused on my work history and ability to solve challenging problems. Finally, I was invited to travel to the company's HQ for a very brief (40 minute) panel interview with 4 team members including peers and group leaders as well as a short phone interview with a leader at the VP level.

 Why do letters in mirrors reverse horizontally and not vertically?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I spoke with 8 different people from different departments within the Sales and Marketing division and had 3 formal meetings.

 Was würden Sie anders machen wenn Sie sich für das Gespräch vorbereitet hätten?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Unprofessioneller Ablauf. Ein Tag wurde für ein Gespräch vorgeschlagen. Auf meine Rückmeldung kam eine Woche keine Antwort. Der Termin verstrich ohne, dass ich eine Absage oder Ähnliches erhielt. Eine Woche später nach meiner 4. Rückfrage kam eine kurze Entschuldigung - der Prozess wurde an neuen Mitarbeiter übergeben - daher die Verzögerung (ohne Absage oder Erklärung). Mitarbeiter hat mich einen Tag später angerufen, ich dachte es ginge um eine erneute Terminabsprache. Stattdessen befand ich mich dann auf einmal direkt im Interview. Das Gespräch war völlig unstrukturiert, er hat mir nicht gesagt wie das Gespräch ablaufen wird und dass es sich bereits um das Bewerbungsgespräch handelt. Fragen nach Vorstellung über die Stelle konnte ich nicht ausreichend beantworten, da Bewerbung Wochen zurücklag und ich keinerlei Vorbereitungszeit für das Gespräch hatte. Dies führte dann auch zu einer direkten Ablehnung meiner Bewerbung mit einer dreisten Aussage am Ende mich das nächste Mal doch besser vorzubereiten. Unprofessionell ohne Ende. Ich werde mich niemals mehr in meinem Leben bei dieser Firma bewerben.",tesla
