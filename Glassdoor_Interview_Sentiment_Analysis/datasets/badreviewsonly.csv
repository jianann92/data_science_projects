There were several interviews where I was asked one question, then the interviewer spent the majority of the time talking about the program, and then opened it up for my questions.

Interviewer had a hard on for what a person knew about the ins/outs of the business, not about what experience the candidate could bring to the team. I learned specific info about the department over a week-end. The interviewer stated to me, ""I can hear that you're reading something, you know nothing about us!"" In fact, I was merely presenting my discoveries (sans notes, from memory). Interviewer stated I should consider a lesser job with LinkedIn. Contacted the interviewer for feedback, no response.

"I interviewed for Associate Product Manager. The interview process was not at all organized. Two phone interviews were scheduled and both the times the interviewers did not show up and they forgot to inform me about that.

"I was contacted by a recruiter on the linkedin platform, due to my experience in network stacks. I had a phone screen, two technical phone interviews (coding on collabit), followed by an on-site interview. The process is unreasonably slow and at times a bit insulting compared to the interviews I did at Facebook and Google. It wasn't a terrible experience, but I would not consider going through the process again without first exhausting the 1st tier options out there.",,Declined Offer,0,,linkedin,471
"I applied through Linkedin and got an email from recruiter after a week for a phone interview. The recruiter was 30 minutes late for the call. Not a great start. I was asked basic interview screening questions and went over my experience. The call took about an hour. The next working day I got an email from the recruiter requesting to organize a phone interview for me with the hiring manager. I replied with my availability but never got a response or confirmation of the interview. I emailed again to find out more but never got a response. I find it very rude that the recruiter didn't keep me up to date on what's going on, at least let me know I didn't get through.",,No Offer,0,Average Interview,linkedin,672

Was asked to prepare a sales presentation; even though I have 20+ years of sales experience. There were supposed to be three people interviewing me (in a panel) and on day of interview I was not asked to present and the other panel interviewers did not attend.

A recruiter called me in late October and said he wanted to have an interview with me for a Talent Manager role. In november I had the first interview with a new HR-person that said she never have had so much to do anywhere before!! The interview went smooth. In december I had an interview via Skype with a very stressed marketing manager. She was very nice but seemed to be very stressed too. I really like the product they have so I decided to go further on if they wanted to. And so they did. I got a F2F interview with the Sales Manager which was too very stressed since it was Q4. During the interview he was typing on his computer and had to go out of the room once to take a call (the 2nd call he took in the room)., No specific one.   ,No Offer,0,Average Interview,linkedin,723

"Some of the interview questions were decent (e.g. intersection of two number arrays) but non-coding questions were about a decade old. Especially when interviewing someone for a Principal position, lame questions can be avoided e.g. Question is: Would you prefer Java over any other language? Ans. I don't know all programming languages. I can compare against the ones i know. You can guess the response.

"I have a very negative impression of LinkedIn after my interview. The engineers did not take time to introduce themselves, talk about my history, the job or team, but dove straight into the technical portion. I was interviewing for a position requiring expertise in data mining and NLP, but instead of talking about anything related to that, they treated me like a code monkey.

Initially contacted by LinkedIn on their site. Very positive about my profile and keen to interview me for a role. Had several phone interviews as it was an international job and then two face to face meetings. The feedback from the phone interviews was extremely positive as was the face to face with quite a senior person.

"I applied in July, took them a month to call me for an interview. Went in for that, met with a couple of the managers, thought it went well, they said they'd get back to me by the end of the week. Week goes by and nothing. I email to follow up (and yes I'd sent TY notes) and again, don't hear back. I write them off thinking I didn't get it and they just aren't going to tell me. Five weeks after the interview I get an email from them wanting me to come in for a second interview that week. I go in and meet with the higher level managers, again, think it goes pretty well, they said they were going to make a decision by the end of the following week. Send more TY notes. It has now been almost a month since the second one and zero communication from them. I'm guessing I didn't get it. I don't see how a company that is supposed to be social and based on communication and helping people find jobs can be so poor at communication and have such a poor hiring process.", If you could develop one skill you do not already possess what would it be?   ,No Offer,0,Average Interview,linkedin,971
