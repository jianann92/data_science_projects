" Describe you experience with x, y, z...   ",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"Applied to the role and was asked to fill out a survey of my skills. Set up a phone interview that was rescheduled by them literally last minute. Interviewer was nice, no behavioral/technical questions but it was just them basically repeating the survey and retyping my answers. Redescribed my experiences using all the tech in the job posting and said info will be passed to hiring manager. It was also clear they did not look at my resume whatsoever, by asking if I have experience with the technology when all my projects use it. Over in less than 10 minutes, hour later rejection email. I assume it's because of my lack of 1 yr experience. Was this not an entry level role? Seriously, why bothering going through the whole process in the first place. Disappointing",Microsoft

All the interviewing panel carried the pride of the company brand and they clearly showed off that they are smarter by asking a lot of coding algorithms. It appeared that they never used those algorithms in their day to day tasks. And of course, all the interview panel were desi guys. Obviously, they acted over smart by showing their extra preparation for the interview. They do not even know the basic concept of giving breaks between interview rounds.

" Would you prefer a development or PM role? (Of course Explorer does both, but they want to see more of what kind of person you are and where you're leaning)   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I initially submitted my application for the Microsoft Explorer role around August/September of 2019, and had an in-person interview at my university for first rounds in October. It was half behavioral, half technical, and I honestly think I choked on the technical part. However, I received an invitation to fly out for final rounds a month later, but my only options for dates were far off, which worried me because Explorer spots run out fast and it's better to do final rounds as early as possible. I flew out early February and interviewed on-site (pretty sure I was in the last group of interviews of the year for Explorer- yikes). I had two interviews- one PM and one technical, and for both interviews, half of the time was spent on behavioral/resume, and the other half on a question. I thought I did really well on the PM interview and alright on the SWE one (I don't want to reveal my interview questions, but I will say that when I searched up my SWE question on Leetcode, it was a Leetcode hard question- so even though I didn't think I did that well on that problem, I think they just asked me it to see how I think, not if I could solve it given the time constraint). I told them about my offer deadline for another company that was coming up and they promised to get back to me before then. They emailed me the day of the deadline letting me know that they were extending an offer to me, but the formal offer was not prepared yet, so they were just letting me know ASAP so I could deal with my other deadline. The formal offer letter arrived a couple of days later. Overall, I had a great experience- the Microsoft interviewers were hands down the nicest interviewers I've ever had, and I could tell they genuinely cared about getting to know me and sharing our work with each other. Microsoft isn't looking for the strongest coders ever for this role- they're looking for people passionate about what they're working on and who know what they are working towards in the future. I'm definitely not the best coder, but I am passionate about my work and about empowering other women in the field, and I think my expressiveness about this made the interviewers like me more and think I could be a good fit for the team.",Microsoft

 Leetcode Medium Questions. Not difficult at all.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"This interview was for AI cognitive science org at Microsoft in Sunnyvale. One recruiter reached out to me and the recruiter recommended AI cognitive science org for me based on my background. I cleared the online assessment and I was told that I will be moving to onsite interviews next. But that did not happen. First recruiter (recruiter 1) handed off the process to another recruiter (recruiter 2) who told me that hiring manager wants to do a phone screen first. The hiring manager kept procrastinating for 2-3 weeks and finally agreed to interview me. The phone screen interview with hiring manager went well and they immediately told me that they want to move to onsite rounds. They cancelled my onsite rounds 2 days before for some random reason which they did not disclose and told me that they want me to come to Bellevue and interview for there. I agreed and went to Bellevue for the onsite interviews. On the day of onsite interviews, I met my 2nd interviewer initially and my 2nd interviewer (who was gonna conduct the lunch interivew) told me that they had not booked conference rooms for 2 interviews. This was weird. I did my first interview in some temporary conference room. It went well. I had a break in between my 1st round and 2nd round. In this break, they told me that I am supposed to sit in that conference and not roam around. I sat in that conference room for 5-10 minutes and suddenly 10 people showed up with for scrum meeting. Apparently the team which I was interviewing for did not book the conference rooms at all. They kicked me out of the conference room. I had to spend my break time in the kitchen area. After my break, I told the 2nd interviewer about what happened. The 2nd interviewer was smiling and I felt that he knew about this but he was trying his best to hide it. The 2nd interview was supposed to be the lunch interview but he completely forgot about ""lunch"" part and took me to his workstation and started asking me whiteboard coding questions. I solved the question and gave him optimal solution. When 20 minutes were left, he suddenly remembered the ""lunch"" part and basically told me to finish my lunch in about 20 minutes. My last interview was a system design interview with hiring manager. The hiring manager works from Sunnyvale but they called me for onsite interviews in Bellevue. They do not have any team members in Bellevue then why invite me there. This was extremely strange. Moreover, the hiring manager joined the interview session via audio call and did not even show me his face. I solved the design question and the hiring manager said that I did a great job overall. I received an automated reject 1 day after. Funniest part of this process was recruiter 2 was hiding under the name of ""conference"" and basically did not even care to join the prep call. So, I never got a chance to talk to recruiter 2 in the entire process. Even the amount the expenses that they have reimbursed (which is less than the approved amount) does not match the amount that they have approved. Clearly they set me up with some fake interviewing process when they were not even interested. Such a waste of time! Rude people! On the other hand, I am glad because I do not want to be a part of such a team/org where they do not respect people.",Microsoft

It started off with a phone interview in which a recruiter read me questions and then wrote down my answers (not responding to them at all, merely pausing so he could write down what I was saying). Then I got invited to the final interview and I set up all the travel and got my flight booked. About a week later I got another email inviting me to the interview, and I responded saying I had already RSVPd but was there anything else they needed from me. They wrote back saying they had cancelled that interview and wanted me to come in three days earlier (which I would not have known had I not responded to the email). This new date was very inconvenient for me so I emailed back asking if it was possible to reschedule, and after a couple follow up emails, they finally replied on Friday in the middle of the night that there was no other possible date, and I had to come in on Tuesday (I live across the country). Their travel team only works monday through friday so they ended up booking my flight a couple hours before I had to leave. Nevertheless I reschedule my prior commitments and show up to the interview only to learn that they had changed the position I was interviewing for (even though I had asked to confirm several times if it was for the same position and they had said it was). I also found out during the last interview that they had my resume from last year. They then told me that I would receive my results within two weeks, but took a month to get back to me, rejecting me.

 What story can you tell me about your time at Company A on your profile as it relates to dealing with highly resistant customers?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I was contacted by an MS Recruiter via email approximately one month after applying online. Had a phone conversation with the Recruiter the very next day and then an “Informational” (conference call) with a member of the Customer Success team that same day. The Informational was great and gave details about the position, the clients, and the team. I was asked to do an all-day interview via MS Teams (w/ video!) about 2.5 weeks later. Since the position would be remote and those who interviewed me (4 people, 1:1 style) were spread out amongst the East and West Coasts, there were no in-person interviews. The interview process was easy to me however, I have been on A LOT of interviews so my views may be different. Each interviewer was interested to know any stories or examples of what I’ve done throughout my career. Each interview was 30 minutes to one hour long. Even though I did not get a job offer, I appreciate that the Recruiter called me on the phone (less than 1 week after the interviews) to tell me I did not get the job. Can you believe this in 2019?! Still impressed and shocked by this. In my 20-year career, I have NEVER had a Recruiter do this. His feedback was that everyone gave me glowing reviews but that they ultimately chose someone that may have ticked more boxes than I did. In the end, although I was disappointed, I feel that there is a reason for everything. Sometimes the position that you feel is the right fit for you may not be at all. Great company and I was so honored to have even been selected to interview as I know they receive hundreds of resumes every single day! One key piece of advice, is to have a thorough LinkedIn profile. At least 3 of the 4 people that interviewed me had my LinkedIn profile up DURING the interview and dove deeper into my experience.

They give you a phone screen with a DS/Algo question in which I passed and was invited to go on-site in Seattle. The process of scheduling the on-site interview was fairly slow and tedious which was the most frustrating part. My on-site interview was scheduled for nearly 4 weeks after my phone screening. The on-site interview was 5 technical interviews (all DS/Algo, no System Design) plus lunch (which is still considered an interview, so do not let your guard down). This was also my first time interviewing on-site for a Big 4 company so I was extremely nervous and wasn't able to perform to the best of my ability on some of the questions I was given.

Which do you like more; PowerPoint or Excel?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"The best way to land an interview is if you know someone in the organization. I had a connection which allowed for an informational late-January. Recruiting started working with me about a week later. The entire process with informational and recruiting took over 7 weeks. Final answer was delayed by over a week. Despite having all qualifications, ample experience and a great rapport in all interviews I was not offered the role. They hired internally instead, reason given: the other candidate had more experience. Subsequently, I pursued another role with a different team (again with a referral), and during that interview the manager felt there would not be enough to challenge me due to my level of experience. So, I seem to fit a very narrow niche? A good hiring team would work with a candidate like me to find the right fit. The trouble with Microsoft recruiting is, that they all work in silos, they support a business unit, not a job category.

They use an outside organization called TrueScreen to compile their background checks for them. They proved to be very unaccommodating to the schedule of a busy college student. The questions on the background check were very unclear and caused issues in the process, which led to many phone calls and emails for clarifying information and additional paperwork, such as W-2's. Apparently, they had called my former places of work and were unable to get in contact with a few of my former bosses. However, when I called my bosses to see what happened, they said they had never received a call in the first place. This all led to negative areas on my background check, which the Microsoft background check review team rejected. They then rescinded my offer. Learn from my experience and be very thorough and detailed on your background check. They are extremely unforgiving and expect every detail to be perfect. Do not delay them in their process either. When they call, drop everything you are doing and answer right away. It was very clear that they did not like to wait and expected you to put down everything you were doing, no matter how important, to answer their questions. I would often be at class and work and couldn't answer right away, and they would call 3 times in a 3-hour span. If you make them wait too long, they will view you as a nuisance and will be unforgiving when compiling your report. They are extremely detail oriented to the point of absurdity. Treat it like another interview. You still have to be on top of your game. All in all, I had a very poor background check experience. Although I had an offer and was qualified for the job and had nothing on my background check beside 2 petty misdemeanors (the legal equivalent of a traffic ticket) they rescinded my offer. I had talked to my recruiter before the background check process to see her opinion on if the petty misdemeanors would affect my chances, and she told me that the charges I had were common and had not hindered other candidates from being hired. Learn from my mistakes and realize these guys aren't messing around. You're just a name on a page to them, so don't give them a reason to not like you. I must clarify my interview was great and was conducted wonderfully. My only complaint is with TrueScreen.",Microsoft

 Present this project (picked from my resume) and what were you contributions to it. Did you face any challenges and how did you overcome them?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I submitted my resume at one of their info sessions at my school. A week later, I was emailed to schedule a 30min interview on campus. The interview went well and was basically a discussion. Presentation of the Supply Chain and Manufacturing group and the positions within the group. He also asked me situational questions such as how do you work in teams or how often do you interact with your superior/professor during projects. About 4 weeks later, I was flown to Redmond,WA for a panel of interviews. 3 days all paid by Microsoft. We were a big group of several backgrounds (mostly Mechanical and Electrical engineering), all applying for an internship or full time in the Manufacturing group. The day before the interviews, we visited the campus and went to diner to meet employees of the group. It was really nice and casual. On the interview day I was part of the afternoon shift. We went to lunch on campus (paid by Microsoft) and then proceeded to the interviews. There was 4 of them, 45 min separated by a 15min break. All my interviews were strictly behavioral (surprisingly!) and I mostly talked about previous projects I had worked on and why I'd like to work there. My advice is, know your resume, be enthusiastic and ask a lot of (interesting/relevant) questions. Really show that you want this. They're not here to trick you but rather test how you'd fit in the group/company. After the interviews we went back to the hotel and went to visit Seattle with a group of interviewees (all expenses paid again). They told us we'd hear from them within 3-5 business days. I got an email the day after coming back home, saying I had an offer and then the HR scheduled a call to discuss the letter content. Overall, the process took about 7 weeks and went smoothly. The only ""down"" side, was the wait before getting invited to Redmond. However, the final response arrived quickly even for people who did not get an offer",Microsoft

The interview was pretty simple, but something weird that the interviewer kept asking was how many lines of code I had written. I had never been asked to quantify my coding skill by lines of code so maybe I'm more inexperienced than I thought.",Microsoft
,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,Flown up to MS office in Seattle in a hotel for 3 days. The experience itself was nice but the method of interviewing wasn't that great.

 What is your brand? (Just had to mention this as the greatest interview question I've ever been asked. I'm going to use myself going forward.)   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Excellent communication and great experience. I had submitted my resume online a while ago and was contacted out of the blue for their Enterprise Architecture position. The experience overall took about 1 month to offer and then an additional 2-3 weeks to start date. It can be nerve racking as you wait to progress through each stage. Definitely practice if you can with someone who has gone through it. There are a ton of nuances that you may not be aware of as an outsider.

" Unexpected: ""When you look at your core circle of friends, are they from school, work, organizations, or other activity?"" I'm really not sure if they were allowed to ask this, but I was certainly not prepared for such a question.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The process starts with ""informational"" interviews where you are vetted, either by HR or the hiring manager. If you are chosen as a finalist you will go through an ""interview loop"" with a half dozen or so people. If the hiring manager is on top of it, he/she will have a strategy where each of the interviewers is asked to explore (aka: drill down) on a particular area of expertise, as well as a specific core value. (This is the company core values, such as integrity, transparency, etc..) They will ask for examples of how you've dealt with different situations, including examples of things that did not go well and how you responded. They will ask about strengths and weaknesses. They are usually prepared and in the majority of cases are friendly (and many are as nervous as you are). It's more important to demonstrate how you think than what you actually did. Do your homework and be prepared. After each interview, the interviewer is supposed to post their ""hire"" or ""no hire"" recommendation for the rest of the upcoming interviewers, with comments to explain your rating, as well as instructions for the next interviewer, e.g. ""drill down on the candidate's experience with people development and collaboration skills"". People are inconsistent in this process and so you won't know if the next interviewer did or did not see comments from the prior interview. Assume they did and if there's something you want to clarify that you thought didn't go well, do it. E.g. ""I would like to clarify my comments to the prior interviewer regarding my experience with ABC. In addition to 1, and 2, I also did 3 and 4 which may have more relevance to this role."" There is always the ""as appropriate"" interview which generally is the GM or VP (depending on the level you're interviewing for) whose valuable time isn't given to candidates that are not likely to make the cut. If you get the ""as appropriate"" interview, you're doing well!",Microsoft

I was under pressure so I just defaulted to techniques I was more used to. Cultural questions were difficult to gauge since I wasn't sure what they were looking for. Some examples of questions include ""If we just released a game and it received a 50 on Metacritic, what would you do to improve that score?"" and stuff like that.",Microsoft

About two weeks later, I was on the phone with a fellow working as a software engineer.

Soon, it was a full software interview, including opening an online document so that he could see me code.

How would you recruit and make partners successful (provide specific past examples of successful execution).   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"The process begins with an in-house recruiter call (basic interview questions, review the role and opportunity - they won't be able to go too deep on the first call). Next call was with the hiring manager to determine fit using basic interview questions, review qualifications, and discuss the role in detail. I didn't find the process to be very formal (no set questions for example). The final step was in-person in Redmond with the recruiter, hiring manager, and peers. This was a 1/2 day with each interview lasting 30-45 minutes on average. Expect more in-depth interview questions to determine capabilities for the role, experience, etc.. From there, it was a follow up call by the recruiter to provide feedback and next steps. In my case, they got back to me within a couple of days with feedback (positive) and then we spent a couple of weeks (too long in my opinion) in the offer negotiation stage.

The travel arrangements (all paid for by Microsoft) were far enough in advance not to cause me stress and when I met with the recruiter, she actually walked me through all of the people I would be meeting and detailed their background/roles. Each interviewer walked me to the next one and in one instance, due to a snafu between reception and the interviewer which led them not to realize I had been waiting, they were quite unhappy with their error and were very apologetic.

 You are given two rectangles. Write a program to find the area of the intersection.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"My initial interview was at my university's campus and lasted approximately 30 minutes. My interviewer was 20 minutes late.. He asked me two questions: 1) What is the biggest technical challenge that you are proud of overcoming? 2) How many elevators do you need for a building (after asking some questions, the building is 40 floors - first 10 floors are retail, the next 20 are corporate, and the top 10 are residential)? 4 weeks later, I finally heard from an interview scheduler that I've made it to the final round interview in Redmond, WA. I had a pending offer so they worked with me to get up there as quickly as possible. They covered everything including airfare, rental car, food, and lodging so that was nice. On interview day, I first spoke with my recruiter for less than 10 minutes. I was rushed to the Bellevue office because of the time it took to get there. I ended up hanging in the waiting room for 30 minutes before I was called. The first interviewer asked me a few questions about my resume and then two technical-ish questions. First one was how would I improve the elevator and the second was to write a program to find the area of the intersection of two rectangles. I didn't have any breaks in between any of my interviews. The second interviewer asked me detailed questions about a project on my resume. He then gave me a scenario with a manager, a dev team, and a customer group. The manager wants me, the PM, to increase revenue by $1mil however way I can. The customer wants to increase by $2mil but they will provide resources. The dev team says that they can do $1mil but it won't be immediate. How do you handle the situation? I guess the main point was to notice that the $2mil is actually not better than $1mil because they will be providing more workers than the dev team would've. I didn't make that realization so that probably is where I lost the position. The next interviewer was late by about 15 min (so I guess I did get some break). We ate lunch and just talked about what I like about Bing and what I don't like and random stuff like what I do for fun. We then went back to his office and talked about things on my resume. He then asked me how I would improve the elevator there. They seem to really like questions about elevators. He then told me that I was done for the day and could head back to the recruiting building. I knew at that point I didn't get it since I only got 3 interviews. They got back to me the next day via email that I didn't get it. Overall, it was a good experience and I hope to try again for full-time in the future.",Microsoft

 Write a function that returns the number of coins needed to make change for any given input value   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The interview started out with a bunch of broad and behavioral questions and then moved on to a technical portion with two different sections addressing the same problem. The broad questions were: Why do you want to work at Microsoft, What would you bring to Microsoft, What department do you want to work in and why, and what Microsoft technology are you interested and how would you improve it. I hadn't thought about any of these things and I was mostly doing the interview to get practice, which the interviewer picked up on immediately.

Anyway, the behavioral questions were tough (for me since I didn't prepare): what makes you better at coding then the other 15 people I am about to interview, why do you think you are qualified for this job, what is your style of writing code, why should I hire you. The technical part began with him asking me to write a function that returns the number of coins to make change for a given input value.

It's an automated tool and each interview casts their vote right after your interview and then enters in comments regarding whether you are a 'Hire' or 'No Hire'. The majority of interviewers have to mark you as a 'Hire' in order for you to interview with the last person. This last person is called the 'As Appropriate' interviewer. In the Program Management discipline, an 'As Appropriate' interviewer is typically the unit head, potentially a Principal level Program Manager or Group Program Manager (GPM).

I got an email that had me indicate what timeslots they listed were possible for me, for a phone interview.

I provided my number and my skype name, and said that skype was the most convenient for me. On time, a woman called me on skype (no video) and the interview went right along. She seemed very good at interviewing. It felt very comfortable talking to her, and she made you feel justified in your thinking, and prompted you if you ran out of ideas. The ""fun questions"" as she called it seemed like brainstorming ideas, anything and everything you think of, you should mention. Get the corner cases, remember safety checks. I got an email 30 minutes after the phone interview ended saying I didn't make the cut. It said I was close, and offered to consider me for a support position, or interview for the developer position again in 2 months.

 Define accountability and explain how you would demonstrate accountability in your work.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Interviewing at Microsoft requires a commitment to the process which can include multiple interviews and a ""finals day"" involiving interviews with multiple panelists.

The culture at Microsoft is results-oriented and the interview process is designed to determine if people have the necessary job skills and are also a cultural fit. Onboarding and training can be somewhat informal in some groups and the organization rewards ""self starters"" that can transition quickly into their jobs while relying primarily on peer mentoring through that process.",Microsoft

Several give me an example of questions- leadership, dealing with a difficult employee, an accomplishment your most proud of etc. They also asked several relationship based selling questions- What tactics do you use to build relationships with customers etc. I have a bacground in sales so this part wasn't very difficult. I didn't receive an offer but I think it was mainly becauwe I didn't display enough passion for tech and the company. Even if you have relevant experience I think this is extremely important to them",Microsoft

 What is an RFP?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"After meeting one of the recruiters at a job fair on the east coast, I quickly secured a phone screen interview with two managers that went extremely well. They flew me across country out to Washington state for a face to face all day meeting. The time difference combined with a full day of interviews was draining to say the least. I interviewed with eight different people. Everything went fine until I interviewed with one guy who was also pegged to be my lunch date for the day. It seems that he was in some kind of political battle with the two managers that wanted to hire me. They warned me ahead of time that he may be difficult. The entire lunch was spent fielding technical questions...most of which were benign..and I began to feel that the job description i had been given wasn't the job being interviewed for. Went I returned, I had to wait in a meeting room while I was being ""discussed"". One thing you will note when you interview here, you will interview with a lot of people and after each interview they will leave you in a room while they talk about you. Also, during many interviews, the interviewer will instant message other interviewers and triangulate your answers with what you have told others. Its very distracting and unprofessional if you ask me. That's something they need to stop. I then met with the hiring manager who was red faced and stated that he had a heated conversation with the guy who took me to lunch. I then interviewed with a couple other people who's job it was to find out if I could be placed anywhere else. I didn't get a job. A few months later, I went thru the process again for another job. Again I had a phone screen that went well, two phone screens in fact. I noted that the manager I talked to seemed a bit down. I later found out he was being demoted. Anyway, they paid again to fly me across country, put me up in a hotel, give me a rental car, and keep me onsite for a day's worth of interviews. I didn't get hired this time either. The problem with microsoft is the culture...it doesn't fit with any other IT company I've worked for. Most employees are young and inexperienced, or have been with the company their entire lives. They have little or no knowledge of the IT industry in general or other technologies outside of microsoft. The project managers I met with didn't know anything that a project manager should, such as what a RFP is, SOW, PMP, etc. The technical guys only spoke in a microsoft context. They said they had worked with other technologies, such as linux, but in talking with them it was clear they had not. The worst was the job descriptions...they are unclear and don't represent what the job is really about, which is also a bit unclear. In the first set of interviews, I thought it was a senior engineer or architect position but it turned out to be nothing more than a 3rd tier technical support job for operations. Nothing I would really have been interested in. I also can't believe they spent so much money bringing me out twice and didn't do a better job of interviewing. The process is condescending to say the least. This is a dead behemoth of a company that still thinks its a startup and has something going on.",Microsoft

 The project that you selected is obviously not the most successfully one. Why did you choose it ?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I'm used to saying that my interview cycle when joining Microsoft was the most challenging I ever faced, easily beating Accenture. I mean every word of it. I had to go through HR, my future manager, my future N+2, but also had to face a 2h ""panel interview"". To this end, I was asked to prepare a 30' presentation describing a project where my contribution made a difference. No more guidance than that: it was not about picking up the most successful project, nor the one I was most proud of, but choosing one where my personal contribution could be clearly established. For the first hour of the panel review, I delivered my presentation and was asked challenging questions by the interviewers (around 5 of them). They had received the deck beforehand and it was obvious that all of them had read it in full and prepared thoroughly. Then we transitioned to the second part, where I was given 10' to prepare C-level conversation about ""how to eradicate Windows XP"". The assignment was to structure the topic into a consultative planning conversation whereby I could convince a decision-maker that I understood the stakes and could be the right man to lead such a transformation. Needless to say that I knew very little about the technical aspects of a WinXP migration, so I built on my consulting background to focus at methodology, team building, phased approach, risk management, etc. They were thrilled, but only after having shot dozens of questions at me! Overall this was the best hiring experience, not only because I genuinely enjoyed it but also because I got a first-hand feel of what my future job would be. It is worth mentioning that the atmosphere was very friendly.",Microsoft

Most of the interviews took a conversation approach - one or two were more pointed with deliberate questions raised. I found the fact that there was an underlying element of asking me to validate the role itself as opposed to why I would be best placed for the role somewhat unsettling.,Microsoft

 Expected questions. Unexpected evaluation.   ,No Offer,,,"Contacted by a MS recruiter on LinkedIn. Got first screen check call by recruiter in 2 weeks and expressed my interest in Dev Lead position. Took a month to receive phone interview. The interviewer was late for half an hour so was rushed. Nice guy, simple questions for half an hour, used an online tool to test my coding for a simple problem: Swap two by two items in a linked list. Got approval email for on-site interview the day after. Took another 3 weeks to attend on-site interview in Vancouver office. Very early interview starting at 7:30 AM !!! with introduction and then 8 AM first interview. Interviewer was a Software Manager, asked about my background and current company and role. Then a question for a Data Structure for keeping large amount of integers and have Insert, Delete and Median functions with best possible performances. Answered the question with pros and cons for each data structure. Had problem to find the best logic for median. Gave me a clue and could answer the question before end of interview. Second interview did it great like 95% correct, a dev lead same intro question then 2 coding questions answered both perfectly with no help, maybe 1-2 small mistakes for boundary check which I found it easily in review. Finished the interview 5 min earlier even so he said let me ask some web questions now that we have 5 mins left, answered all except one. After second interview the recruiter came to my room and said that the team does not want to interview me more!!! I got shocked! Bad sign since I've read before that if you don't have the 3rd or 4th interview you have not made it likely. I said I applied for a Dev Lead position, but no leadership or management questions yet. Got very much disappointed after 2 weeks of preparation and studying over 500 interviews. I'm very sorry for my interviewers if they really think with that performance and Resume and without asking any leadership or management questions, their time is not worthy to spend more than 2 interviews with me. Got very very DISAPPOINTED because I spent days and hours to prepare for them but they simply ignore me. I think it was not my lucky day.

 Design a type of application that would allow coders to talk to each other and work on code together.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Microsoft was doing a meet and greet with students at my university. I dropped off my application and got an e-mail asking whether I would be interested in an interview about 1-2 weeks after initially dropping off my application. The interview process is two-fold. First is the on-campus interview. They basically asked the university for some rooms in the computer science building for a couple of day so they could interview students. I got interviewed by one of the guys that works in the Visual Studio department. We first started off with why I want to work at Microsoft and which type of products I would be interested working on. Next came the more technical questions (i.e. what programming languages do you know). I mentioned that I was programming in C and C++ at the time (due to doing a course on operating systems). The interviewer than proceeded to ask me to write a function that could spot a palindrome (in C) and also have error detection (i.e. if you input a -1 it returns and error). This part was a bit tricky cause I wasn't used to writing code on paper and I was already nervous which didn't help. But, after initially starting to write, the code started to flow and that part went well. Next, I was asked to design a sort of version control application that coders could use when working on projects. I asked the interviewer questions regarding specs and then just ran with it. I literally did not stop talking about the design until he told me to stop. I honestly think that's what got me through to the second round of interviews. Overall, the experience was really good. I'll be going for the second round of interviews in August.",Microsoft

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Recently there was an opening with MS-Hyd for Senior Software Operations, It’s dream come true for any IT professional to join MS (even getting shortlisted for interview is an achievement). I was approached by 2 top staffing agencies in India for this position and none of them able to get my profile shortlisted. (95% of the staffing agencies can’t be trusted). I saw the same opening on naukri which I applied but there was no response so I thought it might have got rejected again ? but to my surprise I got a call from MS-HR on a Saturday noon to appear for F2F interview, I was given the slot for next day (hardly a day to get my self prepared for MS) as they were visiting Pune for recruitment. I tried to get more information about the interview process and details and clarification from the HR but they didn’t took much interest in telling me the details, so based on the requirements mentioned in the JD I prepared myself and reached venue on time on Sunday. Finally panel arrived and after waiting for 30 min’s I was being escorted by HR to the interviewer cabin. (except his name I still don’t know his designation). He briefed me about the profile and started his technical round, to my surprise that guy was more interested in those areas where he had expertise without looking at what exp. and expertise I have. I was being grilled badly by him because the technical round was out of my expectation and my expertise area. So this way I lost an opportunity to be part of MS just because of ignorance of the HR panel for not providing me correct information and insufficient time to appear for the interview (considering it’s MS and not any tom,dick and harry company). I was really frustrated and annoyed the way this ended. My suggestion to everyone being called for interview is to get as much details from HR before appearing for interview (F2F, Telephonic or Written) otherwise you will be also ending up in same fashion. As per me I would rate my interview process “Very Tough” just because of incomplete information provided to me. Good luck to everyone!!",Microsoft
