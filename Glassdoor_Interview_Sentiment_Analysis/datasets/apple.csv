 Tell us about your experience working with a large engineering team:   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"The interview process took a total of about 3 weeks. A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn about a role and then set up an initial call. Next, I had an interview with the team's Design Manager. The final onsite was virtual due to COVID-19, but consisted of a 1-hour portfolio presentation with the whole team and then four 2 on 1 interviews and a 1 on 1 with the Design Manager. These video calls were split up over two consecutive days (Thursday and Friday). I thought the interviews went really well! On Monday morning, the recruiter emailed me to ask if I had time to chat. She then waited to call me until 6:30pm (she was 30 minutes late) to tell me that the team decided to go with someone internal because it would be faster to get them up to speed. I was very sad and frustrated at this point because A) the recruiter waited all day to give me bad news, B) she was late to that call where I was sitting staring at my phone waiting, and C) they ended up giving the job to someone who already had a job AND already worked at Apple. As someone who was impacted by the pandemic and lost my job in May, I was disappointed by this. Why bother interviewing external people if you are just going to hire someone from another internal team? I love Apple as a company and talked to a lot of really smart and interesting people, but this definitely hampered my opinion of them a bit.",Apple

Before the phone interview, the guy would email back at the drop of a dime. But, since the interview...nothing. I understand things can change in a place like Apple just like that. But, being a professional recruiter...the least you could do is send an email saying that things didn't work out or things changed. I emailed the guy and still nothing.

I got an email back from someone at the store I applied to, and we set up a phone interview for an earlier date. The phone interview lasted about 15-20 minutes. The guy was very polite, and the entire process was very comfortable. He emailed me immediately following the interview to see if we could set up an in-person interview at the store. I agreed. This interview was 2 days after my phone screening. I interviewed in person with 2 people. One of them was male and one was female. They were both very nice, but the female was not paying attention to anything I had to say. She was looking around the store, checking her Apple watch, and when I would finish answering a question she had asked me, there was a long silence and then she would look at me and say, oh i'm sorry, what? So that was frustrating for me because I was really focused on the interview, but I felt she was not taking it seriously. Nevertheless, I received an email within a day or two asking me to come in for a third interview. This was with one person. He was very polite, and the conversation was very laid-back. I received an email the next morning asking me to approve a background check as part of the hiring process. Overall, I am very happy with the process, minus the one person who did not seem interested in speaking to me.",Apple

" Classic interview questions, everything was very hush hush from their end, as expected.   ",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Phone screening with recruiter, then with team member, followed by on-site interview with 7 team members. On-site interview was not cohesive. There were mistakes made by the recruiter so that team members were facetiming to interview me while I was already talking in person to someone. Every person I talked to was obviously extremely stressed out working at Apple, so that came off as an extreme negative. They could sense that I didn't want to kill my life to work at Apple like they were so I felt that that hurt my chances of getting an offer.

All told, it was about a 7-week process. The phone interview was only 30 minutes and was mostly about me as a person and how I prefer to work. The homework assignment was fairly simple – but a little gotchya here, they used it as fodder for my first on-site interview session, expecting me to have all that 2-week-old information at the forefront of my mind. The on-site interviews were all pretty great, though – everyone was very nice, helpful, friendly, etc. No big gotchya questions or pointless tidbits like trivia, etc. A bit of whiteboard coding (my first experience with this) but it didn’t matter what language you decided to write in (or even pseudo-language) or if you made syntax errors in that process – it was all about the “why?” behind the code you were writing. On-site was 6 separate interview sessions involving 8 people and was spread out over 5.5 hours with a break for lunch. They got back to me within a week of the on-site interview.",Apple

A few minutes after the scheduled time I received a call from an Apple employee, not the manager. He asked me to describe my experience. I began describing my first job since some of the skills I acquired were relevant to the job at Apple. I was interrupted after 10 Sec. He asked if I knew how to program in C. I said yes, I have been writing firmware in C for several years. Then I started describing a firmware project I developed in C. After about 10 Sec. he interrupted me again, asking if I knew C++. I answered yes and that I also knew C#, and Python. I tried to continue with the description of the work I have done that is related to this job but was interrupted again, almost as soon as I began. This time he wanted to know if I knew Matlab. Neither Matlab nor C++ were mentioned in the job description. That concluded the first part of the interview. He asked me some basic questions about RTOS and version control programs. ""What is a semaphore?"" ""What is a mutex?"". Then the interview shifted to a website I could edit. There were several tricky puzzle book type problems. These do not test a person's ability to design or debug software. If someone had to solve them he/she would just write a short program or evaluate it with a script. But none were real world problems. And I doubt the interviewer would be able to solve them without himself. After that the interview ended. The interviewer was impersonal and didn't ask if I had any questions.",Apple

 Why Apple?   ,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I received an email invitation to an Apple Hiring Event at a nearby Apple store. I RSVP'd and prepared for the interview as this was my first time interviewing with Apple, a company I had been applying to for over 5 years! 2 weeks later was my first interview at 10am on a Sunday and I was instructed to arrive 15 minutes early wearing business casual attire. There were 5 people interviewing including me. We waited until 15 minutes past the hour before one of the managers finally directed us towards the food court area of the mall. The first thing we had to do was fill out a paper that included our contact info, availability (full-time, part-time, hours), and the position(s) we are interested in. This is when I knew it was a waste of time as the choices only included positions like Specialist, Genius, etc. Remember, I had applied for the Manager position? I wrote on the paper that I applied for a manager position since it was not a listed option. The panel interview was very simple. First every one introduced themselves. Then we passed around an iPad to play a ""game"" where we selected tiles that had questions. Each person answered 3 of these random questions. Afterwards, the manager asked us one question - Why Apple? Everyone took turns answering this. We were told that within 1-2 days we will find out if we will move forward or not and if so, to expect 5 interviews total. The following day I received a missed call and a text message from a different manager to schedule a follow-up interview. The communication at this point was very informal and quite poor. Finally on Thursday I heard back asking me to come in the same day for the follow-up interview. This time it was a different manager. Again, I arrived 15 minutes early and I waited 30 minutes past our scheduled time and 45 minutes total before we walked to a bench near the food court of the mall. This time it was one-on-one and very laid back. The manager told me a little bit about himself and then asked me to do the same. He then asked me whether I'm looking for full-time or part-time. I replied full-time and he said well we are only looking for part-time at the moment. I then questioned him what position I'm even being considered for because I had applied for a manager position and he told me they need part-time specialists. The rest of the conversation was an attempt to convince me to accept a part-time retail job and how this can be my foot in the door. What a joke. Imagine someone applying for CEO and gets invited for a line worker.",Apple

Then, the same day I was called back and asked to come in for a third (and final) interview with the store manager. This was the longest and most personal interview, but honestly a great experience! We walked around outside actually and he asked for specific stories about experiences I have had both personally and professionally. Again, he explained what they were looking for and asked what I was looking for to make sure it was a good match. This interview was about 45 minutes long, and the manager and I got on very well right off the bat. Also, a lot of this interview was me asking the manager questions. It is important to have a list of strong questions ready for the interviewer to show that you are interested in the position. It’s ok to ask about pay (which they won’t disclose until they make you an offer) and hours, however you should have more questions prepared that really spark a conversation and show your interest.",Apple

The process took a month, then I got a call saying ""no, not now"". After giving so many interview, it really was disappointing because I felt like I wasted so much time.

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"Applied in October of 2017, Got an email in March to set up a time to talk. Phone screen was around 15 minutes and then I was told I would move onto the next step. Got an email two weeks after to set up a time for the interview.

I did that when she asked me to give a past situation with a rude customer so she skipped the role play and instead asked me rapid fire questions to test how I would think on the spot. Overall, it was a fairly easy interview and the interviewer made me feel really comfortable.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied for both positions and received a request to come in for an in person interview at the Apple store. It was 3 candidates in the interview together where they asked basic questions about our lives and what we like about Apple. Then, one candidate asked about specific positions that were open and the interviewer said that 80% of hires come in as a basic sales person for the Apple store and go from there. I was not interested in working in a mall retail store but I did not let on to that fact. I asked how quickly people move up from the basic position and was told that it depends on their experience in the store. I finally asked specifically about the positions that I had applied for and they told me that those positions are always “left open” but they never hire for them. I answered every question better than I the other candidates in the interview especially because one openly stated that she knew nothing about Apple and the other continuously bashed Apple during her answers. At the end, the interviewers asked me if I’d be interested in full time or part time as a basic “specialist” (sales associate). I told them full time. It went well, even though I felt like it was a waste of my time. A week later, I reached out to the manager I met with for the interview to let him know that I had not heard from Global Recruiting (they said everyone goes through 4 interviews). He responded immediately and said he would reach out. Within an hour I received a basic canned rejection letter stating that they were moving forward with other candidates.

 Basic situational questions; study others on here and you should be fine. Be passionate and smile   ,Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"After a month of interviews for this supposed prestigious company, i can’t believe the BS I went through. Unlike any other review I’ve seen on here, I went through 5, yes 5, interviews. 4 in person and 1 in store. Towards the end ie interviews with the store/regional manager and phone call offer, I was NEVER given the exact dates of training, nor was I told that if i couldn’t make all 3 days of back to back 9-6 training, i couldn’t be hired. What is work life balance, right??? I even told them I’m in school and I could make 2 out of the 3 days, but not the third as I can’t miss 3 classes in 1 day. Apparently this wasn’t good enough, as if I’m expected to drop my life to work with this company. I was constantly told by the manager whom I was in contact with post-offer if I had any thoughts or if maybe it wasn’t the right time and that they should go with other options. It was quite clear he wanted to revoke the offer, yet continued to put it off. I thought I saw a light of day when he said he’d keep my name down Incase something opened up after my semester, but then he said i would have to interview all over again. WHAT?????? Another month and another 5 interviews? No way. Not for a part time retail job. I could say so much more about what went wrong in this hiring process, but if I have any tips for anyone planning to work with this company, make sure the managers hiring you are CRYSTAL clear. The lack of communication on the part of the Apple store I applied to is absolutely horrendous, and they need to take a damn good look at how they handle these things.

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was in my local Apple Store in September of 2017 and some of the employees encouraged me to submitted my resume and see what happens. That's exactly what I did. I hadn't heard back from Apple until January of 2018 in which they invited me to a group hiring event. I had this first interview with two other candidates and one Apple employee. We went upstairs and found a small lounge in the middle of the mall and went around answering questions and having a conversation. This interview was very casual and at times felt more like a discussion than an interview so be ready to not only interact with your interviewer but your fellow interviewees! Exactly one week later I received a call from a very nice young woman from the store inviting me to a second interview. This second interview was a one-on-one with a newly hired manager so she was as nervous (yet confident) as I was! She asked me a variety of personal, professional, and technical questions, but again this felt more like a discussion than anything else so be prepared to go deeper into answers and questions. At the end of the interview she said she was really impressed and that I am a candidate for this position. However, the store was currently fully staffed and she said I must be patient although she wanted me still to meet with the stores Senior Manager for a third interview. I got a call the next day to setup my third interview. This interview was a bit more involved as this was the highest level manager I had met with. He again asked me all the good questions and we talked a lot about my current employer as he was familiar with said company. The interview went very well and at the end he mentioned that not only was this the store fully staffed, but this is the slowest time of year so I must be patient. He explained that the purpose of these interviews is to gather a pool of qualified candidates to fill positions as they open up. He told me he definitely wanted me to meet with a Store Leader in the coming weeks and most likely a Marketing Leader after that. I told him that I was honored for the opportunity to interview and be considered as a candidate. I went on to explain how I was happy with my current position at my current employer and am ready to put my patience to the test. He said that this is good for me that I am happy with my employer and it is good for them because they can bring me on the team when the time is right. He told me to expect a call in the next week with more information on the next steps. The next day I receive a call to set up a fourth interview with a Store Leader for two days later. I was caught off guard by the urgency of this next interview as at the conclusion of the third interview with the Sr. Mgr we left off at meeting in the 'next few weeks.' I believe they may be testing my level of commitment by telling me there's no openings yet continuing to meet with my.

She was 45 minutes late to our phone interviewing and after talking for about 25 minutes, she said ""let's have you come in to meet the team."" They raised my hopes like it was if I was already hired. It took the recruiter nearly 2 months to find a 3 hour block of time that would fit the schedules of 5 different people that the hiring manager wanted me to meet. The second person that I interviewed with kept looking at his phone and was not fully engaged. This is rude in my opinion. The last person I met, the hiring manager, came 15 minutes late, told me, ""I'm sorry, but I'm tripled booked today,"" and only had 10 minutes to talk to me. The most important person that wanted to meet me didn't have time for me. WTF?

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I’ve interviewed on multiple occasions at four different locations. Once you submit your resume it can take anywhere from a day to a month to get an invite. If you are lucky enough to get an invite to interview you will be notified by email to rsvp a spot on a particular day and time, usually 8:00 or 9:00 am. Depending on the location of the store you applied to the interview can be either in the store itself before the store opens or at a designated location outside the store. Info and directions will be provided by email once you rsvp. The first interview is always a group interview with at least five other candidates. You will fill out a form asking for your name, email, contact phone number, your availability, which four locations is your preferred to work at and what Apple products you are familiar with. Once everyone has finished filling out the form the interviewer will collect all the forms along with the individual’s resume and the interview will begin. Every interviewer has had a different approach as to how they conduct the interview but all will follow three steps. First the interviewer will ask the candidates to introduce themselves, tell the group a bit about themselves and why they want to work at Apple. Second the interviewer will pass around an iPad. Each candidate will tap on a random number from 1 to 6 on the screen and answer the question that pops up. Depending on the interviewer only that candidate may answer that question or all the candidates may take turns answering the same question. And third and final step the interviewer will take any questions you may have. Once the interview is over you will be notified by either email or phone call whether you have moved up to a second interview. In my experience if you are emailed you did not make it. Phone calls are reserved for candidates that have moved on to a second interview. I have only made it to a second interview once in the multiple times I’ve interviewed. The second interview will be a one on one with the leader in charge of the department which you have applied to and will consist of more personal in-depth questions about your personality and to describe why you are the best candidate for the job. Be prepared for a lengthy interview process as I have heard from former co-workers currently working at Apple that you may have up to five interviews before getting hired.",Apple

I enjoyed the process because I got to meet many of my superiors before even working there.",Apple
,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I finally received an offer from Apple and thought it was only fair to share my experience on this site since it help me prepare for my interviews. I believe the most difficult part from the whole process is actually being offered an interview. They have to go through hundreds of submissions, and even if you are well qualified, your application can get lost in the bunch.My advice is to keep your profile updated and resubmit your application after a few months if you have yet to get an interview. The interviews were really relaxed and not really structured like your usual interviews. My first interview was with a store leader and 4 other candidates; this interview took outside the store. We introduced ourselves and then answer a situational question (STAR format). My advised is to stay engaged, offer to answer first, and listen to the other candidates. The Store Leader also talked about the positions that the store offers. Keep in mind that the position that you apply for may not be the one you end up with. After that, we filled a sheet with basic information along with our skill level with Apple product and services, and our availability. We were told that we will hear back by Friday (interview was on Wednesday). They are terrible at following through with call back timeframes and I would suggest asking the interviewer if they have an email in which you can get in touch with the recruiter just in case you don't hear back from by the given timeframe. I got called back a week later and was offered a one-on-one interview with another interview. This was a very laid back interview, very conversational, again with STAR format interview questions. Remember to answer with a specific situation and its outcome, not what you would do if you were in that situation. After this interview, I didn't hear back until a month later to schedule a third interview with another Store Leader. My third interview was basically the same as the rest. However, during this interview I was asked what position was interested in. She said she would see that positions were available, which puzzled me. But I think they want to have someone available as soon as a position becomes available. She told me that if they decide to move along with me, my fourth and final interview would be with the District Leader. I didn't hear back until a month later, offering me fourth interview. The interview with the District Leader was very laid back as well. I think all of these interviews are for the other Store Leaders to meet you and to see if you would be a good fit. The District Leader apologized for the long process and told me that it would not take as long to hear back to see if I would receive an offer or not. It took a month for the recruiter to reach back to me to offer me a position. It was an overall easy interview, however I would suggest to practice your answers with a friend or by yourself to see how prepared you are. They are mostly like ""Tell me a time you _________; how did you resolve it?"". These questions are to see how good you are at handling different situations. I was not asked any questions on Apple products or services, they don't care about that. They will teach you that during training. They want you to be a customer service oriented person. They want to know that you will be able to take care of their customers. However you may be asked how you like a specific product that they see in your possession. Again, easy interview, but inaccurate callback timeframes. If you are not a patient person, you might want to ask how you can follow-up if you don't receive a call back by the date they give you.",Apple

I wrote down specific answers in advance so I was prepared. The second interview was intense. I had to video chat with 2 managers at the same time and bounced back and forth answering interview questions from both. I had to role play during video chat. I was asked about what I thought the job entailed and how I would fit into the position. If I would be available for the training and normal business hours of operation. In the end, I was not chosen for the position. I would reccomend hardwiring your computer to your internet connection and have a headset or headphones to use during the interview.",Apple

So, other than their experience at Apple, they no nada in comparison. 2nd to last interview I was asked if I owned an iPhone. I could tell that my owning an Android, but all Macs otherwise perturbed him and he decided in a flash that I was an unworthy prospect. Most of the questions/talk was the ushe - why do you want to work for Apple? Tell me about yourself. How do you use your Mac? Do you own an iPhone? The fact that they don't know that or check customer accounts before they interview is lame. He hadn't even read my resume before meeting and asked questions that the first line would have answered.

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Applied on October 2nd 2017. Received an invitation to interview on October 4th and rsvp’d for the 22nd. My first interview was a group setting, there were five of us at a table at a bakery within the mall that we all walked to together. We all introduced ourselves and later passed around an iPad which had a series of random questions for us to answer. My best advice is to be as outspoken and ask questions when given the opportunity. At this point I noticed the first interview was more of a getting to know us and to see how well we answered unexpected questions. I remained confident and smiled the entire time which I believe helped. Received a call 24 hours later in which I was invited to a second interview round. This time it was me and two other people from the first, so it was obvious the other two were eliminated. This one took place at a table in the grass (outdoor mall) with the Store Leader and another Recruiter. This one was more laid back as there was no iPad questions but more about how we dealt with situations in our previous roles, the questions were definitely a bit more difficult as they really wanted us to elaborate on how overcame difficult situations. One thing Apple likes to go by is the “Lominger Competencies”, so definitely looking that up and mentioning it at the second interview helped me a lot. About an hour after my second interview I was called in for round 3 to take place on November 1st with the store leader again and a Market Leader along with the two other candidates from my second interview , this interview was more of conversation as the market leader said we wouldn’t be there if management didn’t feel we were good fits, therefore we were only asked why we wanted to work for Apple and what our passions were, by this time they didn’t mention we had gotten the positions but it was pretty obvious we did, everyone was super awesome throughout this somewhat lengthy process and Thursday November 2nd I was told my background check would begin.

 what's your favorite apple product.   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"Applied online, received and invitation for a group interview which you must schedule. In order to schedule the appointment your email address that you used to apply must be the same as your Apple ID. The first interview was a group interview which lasted for two hours but went by relatively quickly. Second interview was a week later. I was there 15 minutes before my scheduled time as suggested but the interviewer didn't meet with me until 30 minutes after I was scheduled. The interview felt rushed which I assume was because an offer was not going to be extended an offer.",Apple
 We only use Excel. How technical are you?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"The application process took 2.5 months. I had 3 phone calls: 1 screening and 2 calls with managers. My final interview was in person in CA and consisted of 4 30 min one on one interviews with a case study at the end. From start to finish the application process was a huge use of time- I was actively interviewing with other companies and I was very transparent about my schedule. Apple did not care much. I made it to the final round somehow and got to see the world renowned Apple campus. The experience was surprisingly underwhelming. The managers seemed to be clueless and awestruck throughout each of the 30 min interviews. There is no tour whatsoever. At the end for the case presentation only 2 of the 4 interviewers showed up. Apple makes you print your presentation so I went to kikos and dropped a casual $60 to print out a presentation that 2 of 4 didn't come to. Then I went home and went on with my life. Never heard back from them and I have spent approx 1 min dwelling on the experience. Sure, Apple is an amazing company if you are a consumer buying an electronic. However, I am confident I will meet my career goals without Apple and that's really why I don't feel sad that nothing came from the experience. I am just amazed at what they are like in real life- it kind of reminded me of what it feels like to find out Santa isn't real. Anyway- good luck to anyone else interviewing with them! Don't feel bad if you never hear back from them... chances are you'll spend 40 hours preparing for the case presentation and no one will show up.",Apple
 How to reduce beam deflection (6 ways)?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I'm an engineer by training. Phone interview with a Senior Manager from Power Accessories. Did fairly well on technical but for some reason was ""not a match"". I asked how many hours per week were you expected to work as well as the energy level of the team and got PR answers for both. As a CEO of my own brand, my advice to executive management is to know your front line talent as well as the type of people you end up promoting to senior level management. After several interviews, I'm starting to see a pattern of the type of people who end up in management at Apple (your quintessential fraternity brother who literally all sound the same on the phone, big on diversity? I think not). Individual I interviewed with was not only unskilled at identifying talent but was clearly not transparent about the work environment as a Senior Manager. Disappointed in the lack of technical and behavioral depth at the management level at Apple and can guarantee two things: 1) either their tenure at Apple will be short lived if this continues or 2) the amount of real engineering talent at Apple will eventually reduce as the shareholders question their ROI and this will happen when the tech bubble bursts...",Apple

The first round is a group interview where they ask you general interview type questions involving previous experiences with customers & coworkers.

This is really the hardest part of the interview process where they ask you a lot of situational type interview questions and really try to get to know you better as a potential candidate.

 Why Apple?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"The first step was setting up an appointment for the first interview via email. When I got there they realized I had been given the wrong day and apologized. Thankfully someone still had time to speak to me and things seemed to go well. It was mostly questions aimed at getting to know me and gauging my interest in the position. I was then told I would be contacted by another manager to setup a 2nd interview within 24-48 hours. After a few days of waiting, I decided to call myself and check in. They were surprised I hadn't been contacted and told me a manager would call within 24-48 hours again. After a week had passed, I finally received a call to come in for another interview. This time it was a different manager and before even saying hello it felt as though she had decided she didn't like me. The whole interview felt very cold and as though she had already made her decision, which was very odd since the first manager had been very welcoming and friendly. I asked what the next steps would involve and she told me that I'd be contacted within 24- 48 hours to set up a third interview and if that went well I'd be scheduled for a working interview. Again, I was not contacted for nearly a week and I happened to be in the area so I stopped by the store to inquire about my next interview. The manager I had seen during the second interview was there and told me she was surprised I hadn't been contacted but that someone would contact me soon. A day or two later I received a generic email saying that I had not been selected. Aside from the initial message, all other forms of contact from them had been calls directly from a manager. I was disappointed that after several weeks of being kept waiting, missed appointments, and multiple interviews they did not call or at least send a more personal email. I sent an email in response thanking them for their time and asking why I was not selected so that I could improve in future applications. They told me I'd get a response to my email soon. It's now a week later I have not received a response. All in all, the process was very disorganized and left a poor impression.",Apple

 Scenario based questions   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,,Apple
 Describe in one word what kind of employee I would get if we hired you.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"For a company with a the motto ""Think Different,"" Apple clearly wants thoughtless drones they can mold into their non questioning slaves. This interview process was the worst I've ever had in 20 years. I arrived early at Barton Creek Mall and waited for quite some time for the interviewer, to get her self together. She was 20+ minutes late and dressed as if she had come from a jog-- sloppy and inappropriate. Her workout bra was showing. She proceeded to take us to the loudest part of the mall to conduct a several hour group 'interview.' Certainly like no interview I've ever had. All of the other applicants were in supplication mode and none showed any particular critical thinking skills or 'woke' thought. With a revenue stream of 215 billion you'd think Apple could afford to do 1 on 1 interviews professionally in a real space instead of the food court of a mall. However, this is how Apple rolls evidently. Push some tables together so we all have to strain to hear and struggle to be heard. Is Apple attempting to simulate it's own obnoxiously loud, over crowded, poorly planned stores? Maybe. Moreover it was disorganized and she appeared unprepared, scribbling sloppy notes on the backs of our resumes and an internal questionnaire with little instruction that repeats some of the same info Apple should already know and availability. She reached for each question as if she was just making it up, but it was obvious she was just trying to remember the standard Apple questions. What she willingly revealed, however, is that at Apple Corporate, there is very little fellowship and camaraderie that is encouraged. At each store, the managers and employees form the current ""family."" If you don't fit in with them exactly, it doesn't matter how qualified, skilled, friendly, or savvy you are; you will not be considered. She said it's like a family with employees hanging together and dating, which seems like a recipe for unprofessionalism, oh wow just as reflected in the stores. She also revealed that the turnover rate is very high, with new positions every 2 weeks and that if we didn't make it this round, to reapply. Alot of this explains why the Apple store is such a semi-failure and why the experience, not from a policy standpoint but from the vibe the employees give varies so much. I sat there for hours, literally, waiting for each applicant to repeat their spiel. Most rephrased the same things over and over. 2.5 hours of my life I will never get back, because Apple thinks it's being super clever. Kind of a disgusting experience to be honest. It wasn't personal; it was dismissive at best. Everyone at the interview is expected to ""get to know each other."" A futile, wasteful exercise-- you'll likely never see those people again. The interviewer isn't really trying to get to know you, just trip you up. Furthermore, though the interview setting would seem conversational; it is not at all. It is simply one-sided back and forth. I constantly felt rushed in my answers. Also you're answering sometimes personal questions in front of people you don't know-- both rude and inappropriate. Mostly just her hurling whatever question she can remember and then letting you struggle to answer above the guy emptying/slamming trashcans 2 feet behind you. Moreover the interviewer told us the job I had been called in for wasn't even available. They just send for a cattle call, another signal of high turnover-- which means their hiring process isn't efficient or working properly. If you don't think for yourself or question authority this might be the job for you. If you supplicate blindly, you're more likely to get to the next round of interviews. Perhaps playing dumb but not too dumb is the key here.",Apple

I did a lot of research (Reddit and Glassdoor) to find out what the process might be like, as well as what would be appropriate to wear. As far as that was concerned, the advice was mostly ""no suit or tie, but nice slacks and shoes, along with a buttoned shirt,"" so that's what I went with. My interview time was a 90-minute window, so I thought there would be a good chance that I'd be interviewing with multiple candidates, which is not uncommon. As it turns out it was just me, and I was warmly greeted by a store manager. Instead of talking in the store, she suggested we walk through the mall. We walked and talked for about 20 minutes. When we had made our way back to the Apple store, I was given the chance to ask any questions I had. The question I asked was what type of hours were usually associated with full-time (40 hours per week) and part-time (20-30 hours per week) work, and could part-time employees be brought on as full-timers if they proved they were trustworthy? The answer was yes, but it was mentioned that the time frame for that could range from 6 to 18 months. My interviewer seemed genuinely interested in me and what I had to say, and I felt comfortable talking with her. Following the interview I asked if I could get her business card (I wanted to know her last name and the store's email address for the ""thank you"" email I sent).

I felt like a friend was asking me about my current job, so my answers were really detailed and natural. One week later I was called to schedule a second interview with another manager.

By the end of the week, actually one day after the initial interview, I was invited to a second one. This was one-on-one at the actual store they were hiring for with the store manager (I believe). She was really nice and laid back so it felt very natural. A few days later I was invited to the final interview with two of the store leaders. It was a pretty lengthy process but if you're a people person (charismatic, outgoing, witty, etc.) and can easily think off of the top of your head, definitely apply. I should also mention that I had to reschedule the final interview due to a conflict, so that added about a week and a half to the process.",Apple

Finally had the third interview which was with a Senior Manager and the main Store Leader. Once that was complete, I got a call the same day inviting me to set up a time to meet the next day with the Regional Manager for a 4th and final interview. Met with him and this interview was much more like a conversation. We talked about our favorite movies and favorite Apple products. 3 days later I was offered the position.

After this you were separated into smaller groups contain about 5 people. An employee would pass around a tablet with questions for each applicant to answer, some questions were easy, others you had to think! As you're answering these questions, try your best to stand out and be engaging! Eventually a manger would come to your group and ask you a question herself, again this is important, you want to stand out to her. I think what was a problem for me, it was that as we were going around answering these questions, I was last, and if you say anything or close to anything someone else said youre not really going to stand out. Eventually the groups disperse and everyone comes back together. At this point you want to ask as many engaging questions as possible.

" two sum, linked list loop, readers-writers problem.   ",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I was contacted by recruiter and then phone screen by manager. Few days later recruiter told me manager was showing interest so scheduled on site. On site is 1:1 with 8 people. Mostly asking about my previous projects and designs as this role requires a specific in depth hands on experience in this domain. They also asked questions on multi threading and few coding questions. It was not that difficult. I could able to answer all of them. If you are attending interviews with other tech companies like Google, Facebook etc.. then this is not that hard. What I felt was repetition, need to explain same stuff over and over to many people. However I could able to meet few wonderful persons. But at the end I didn't meet the director, which is a sign of rejection I guess. After a week I got a message from recruiter they are not proceeding with my application. It's a surprise to me as I've more experience than this role requires and answered all questions to the best of the my knowledge. Perhaps they are looking for less experience candidates not a technical leader.",Apple
" Signed an NDA, so I'm going to abstain, but if you regularly practice your data structures and algorithms, you will be fine. The key is to *regularly* practice.   ",Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"Contacted by the recruiter via email, followed by two separate phone calls with someone from engineering. Both conversations involved writing quite a bit of code for most of the hour. After that, I was invited on-site for a full day of fun and games. The day started at 10 am and finished at 5 pm. I interviewed with 9 people that day, 7 out of the 9 were technical. The others were more cultural/behavioral. It was a rough day. We went through all of the well known data structures in every way possible -- and more than once. Trees, lists, queues, stacks, heaps, hash tables, you name it. Traverse them, search them, reverse then, populate them, rearrange them, make them thread-safe. Use recursion. Use iteration. By the end of the day, I felt like I had taken 3 SAT's back-to-back. Frankly, I'd categorize most of the coding problems that I received as medium in difficulty but the challenge was in the sheer quantity of them. Personality types varied widely over the course of the day. Some people were more intense than others. On the whole, I walked away feeling like I know what the hardest software interview in the valley is like now. The recruiter got back to me within a few days and informed me that the feedback was positive and that they wanted to schedule a final conversation between me and one of the execs. After that, they made me an offer. I assume that the mileage varies as far as interviews go, depending on which team you're talking to. I wasn't expecting the gauntlet to this degree, although that's probably a good thing, because if I did know what was waiting for me, I'm not so sure that I would have had the confidence to go in there. Software is hard, but writing software under pressure, knowing that a job offer (that you presumably want) is on the line is a different ball game entirely. Know your data structures, people. Know your algorithms. Know the Big-O complexities of everything that you write, both spacial and computational. If you don't, you will bleed. The good news is that making it through the coding part of the interview is very possible for most people who are willing to set aside 30 minutes every day to practice.",Apple

The interview itself was super straight forward. There were several interviews with 2-4 people and they asked me questions varying from topics like what drives me forward, my technical experience, and cultural fits. It also seemed like they made the personalities of my interviewers different. Some were super hip and talkative, others were awkward and didn't feel like they wanted to be there and some were over FaceTime. I also had lunch with the team leader and my final interview was with the executive for developer publications. After those interviews, I didn't hear from them for one week and then the recruiter scheduled one more call with me to explain that I didn't have enough experience at that time and that he would reach out again in several months.",Apple

The following day I went in for the interview and again expected no reply until after thanksgiving. But that Wednesday before thanksgiving I got an email saying they're not moving forward. Broke my heart a little but that's life. Manager said it boiled down to what other candidates had to offer experience wise. But from what I know they hire strictly on personality. Maybe he didn't know how to tell me I have a terrible personality? Lol it may legitimately have been experience though. Some people have personality and experience, and that makes them optimal. One of the guys in the interview with me used to work at that exact Apple Store a few years back. I'm not sure how I was supposed to compete with him exactly. Other than the few days of being super sad after the email, the whole process was pretty cool and it showed me a calm, social side of me I never knew.

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. After 2 weeks of no response, I re-applied and this time had updated my resume slightly and I had received a recommendation from an Apple employee. About a week after applying a second time I received an invite to their hiring event. I had read a lot about what the hiring event looks like and you can read other reviews to get the details but the basics were exactly how I expected. You show up to the hiring event (in my case it was at a hotel) and you sign in. After a brief wait, we entered in classic Apple fashion; all of the employees were cheering and clapping as we entered the room. After settling in, it was introduction time. Employees first, then applicants. They wanted your name, amount of customer service experience and favorite doughnut. They seemed to just be getting a feel for you, don't overthink this part. After introductions, they showed us 3 different videos about Apple and working at Apple. This is your opportunity to start standing out from the crowd. Ask good questions about the video, and make sure to repeat your name before you talk since they have a lot of applicants and you need to be remembered. Focus your responses on how you love people and that's what you love about Apple, because Apple loves people, too. Next is the iPad Pass and Play session. You break into small groups of about 6 applicants per one employee. You're given an iPad and asked to read the question aloud and then answer it. No questions were repeated and you don't get to answer other people's questions. I'm just getting into the job market as a recent college grad so I've been through a couple interviews already, but I was really surprised by how some of the questions were. They weren't completely original, but they had just enough of a twist on them to make some of them difficult and you had to be able to think on your feet well. A couple people in my small group really struggled tying their stories to a specific skill they had, or making the story seem relevant to the question. Each person answered 3 questions and on the iPad it recommended you keep your answers to 2 minutes in length. After Pass and Play it was question time. All the employees lined up front and they took about 6 questions from the whole group before they dismissed us. Don't waste this chance with a question like, ""Can I transfer stores?"" They're looking for thought-provoking questions. They told us after we finished that we would receive an email either way. The email would either be an invite to the second interview, or it would say they are not able to accommodate you at this time. I had read in multiple places that people heard back same day, or within a day or two. Not the case for me, I had to wait a week before I got my email invite to the second interview. I haven't had the second interview, but I will update once I do.",Apple

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"The interview process took about 3 weeks. I applied online for a specific Apple Store and after one week I got the e-mail invite for the first group interview. This one was an easy one. We were 6 candidates so it was kind of chill. Our interviewer was one of the Apple Store manager were I applied. We started by introducing ourselves to the group by saying the name and the answer to the general question ""What is your dream car and why"". After that, we started to answer some questions written on an ipad. First, the guy next to you answer his question and then when it's your turn, you need to swipe to get yours. You can skip the first one, but you need to answer the second one if you skipped. In the end we got the chance to ask some questions to the interviewer. It's good to have one or two questions. After about a week I got the phone call for the second interview. This time it was a one on one with another store manager. The questions are quite similar with the questions you get on the ipad in the first interview : Why Apple? Tell me something about your passions. What's the difference between customer experience and customer service, Describe a time when you had to handle a difficult customer. Don't lie, don't be a robot. Be yourself because every question might have a followup question so your story needs to be strong. After the second interview I got a phone call 25 minutes later to set up the third and final interview with the store leader. This one was also a one on one interview but in another building, office.

 Typical interview questions   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied in mid June of 2015 and heard back around mid July 2015 with an email inviting me to a ""Hiring Event"" which occurred at the Apple store that I was applying too. There was about 15 of us when I got there. Basic group interview. They show you some videos explaining what it's like to work there and give brief introduction. After that everyone else gives a brief description. Once that was done, we split into two groups. The business leader was in my group and passed around an iPad which contained your normal interview questions. After everyone answered, he asked one final question to everyone, then the two groups met again. The Apple employee's asked us if we had any questions (definitely ask some) and then we handed in our resumes with a completed form (which you are asked to fill out. It contains your availability, locations you want to work out, and what Apple products that I have used.) They didn't say whether we would here back or not. About a week passed and I got call asking if I can come back in for a second interview with the market leader. Once that time came, she actually couldn't make it so ended up being myself with a business leader and hiring manager. They asked your typical interview questions. I brought up a lot of experiences with my previous job and it was pretty simple. They then said I would hear back from them within a week on whether or nor I was going to the next round. I got called then again exactly a week later asking to see if I can come in a week from then to finally meet with the market leader. Once that came up, I actually recognized people from the original group interview there. There was actually 5 of us (including me) all meeting up to talk to the market leader for the final interview. This one definitely felt more like a conversation than an interview. She just asked normal questions like ""what would you do if a customer asked about an Apple Watch?"". After that I was done, I received a call 4 hours later with an offer contingent with a completed background check. Definitely be yourself and try to have a bubbly personality. Be outgoing and not afraid to talk to people.",Apple

I received an email inviting me to attend a job hiring event at an off-site location on a certain day for which I could choose an available time slot. I showed up that morning with about 20 other people seated at several tables around a large room. We were advised it wasn't a competition as many of the people in the same room might not even be there for the same positions. We did some role playing activities and other interactive things. I felt like they were just trying to get a piece of what our personalities were like. Apple LOVES people and doesn't really care so much about how much you know about their products or whether or not you even love what they make. They're just interested in hiring great people. I heard back via email later the same day inviting me for a 1:1 interview at the actual store I'd be applying to work in. That interview was about 1 week after the group interviews. I met with a local store leader and we had about a 30 minute conversation going over details of the job and taking care of all of the basic questions. I left feeling great and knew I had made a good impression. A few days later I received an email asking for some time to talk over the phone.

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I interviewed for the itunes, email/chat support. The entire process (not including the background check) took about a month. I applied on June 7th and was contacted for the first interview on June 23rd. The first interview was about 15 mins long and pretty basic. The recruiter told me about the job and then asked some basic tech questions like ""how do you load your music into itunes"" and ""what would you tell someone who accidentally deleted itunes from there computer (how would you help them to get itunes back onto there computer)?"" then there was a role play. In the role play the customer had gotten an itunes gift card for her birthday and the card was empty, ""how would I respond to this customer?"" The name of the game here is empathy (saying ""I understand"" and NOT ""I'm sorry this happened to you""), also being really enthusiastic about customer service and Apple in general will really help you (I was so enthusiastic I kinda felt like a spaz afterwards, haha). Second interview was a week later over web cam. The recruiter was very friendly. They asked me questions like ""what is my history with Apple products"" and we did a role play here also. I had to compose an email, start to finish, solving a customers issue. The issue was ""my husband downloaded a bunch of games onto my ipad, how do I delete them."" I think they want to see your writing style and make sure you use proper grammar and spelling. From here I was offered a third interview and they would be emailing me within a few days to set it up. Got the email the next day and scheduled my third interview for the next day after that. Now I wont lie, the third interview was HARD. If your preping for this one read the questions people post on here, there gonna ask you those questions. My third interview lasted about 60 mins and half of that was in chat. So the chat part was the most difficult. It starts off easy, 2 chats at the same time, both with different issues (you have to keep them separate and distinguish who your talking to in each response) then a third chat was added, then a fourth (at this point I was getting really stressed) fifth and then a sixth. So you've basically got 3 different interactions going on at any given time. Keep in mind you have to show empathy when responding!! The person I interviewed with brought that up, that I had some great empathy statements. Afterwards the person interviewing me said I did really well for my first time with chat support, they also let me know that I did have a few typos though. So after the interview, I felt like it went well, not great, but ok. I honestly felt like it could have gone either way.

She said she was moving me to the next interview which was scheduled for July 29th. This was a FaceTime interview with another HR member. It only lasted about 20 minutes. Went over the roll and how training worked. Did 2 role plays involving the iPad video question and dropping the iPhone in the ocean question. At the end he told me he was moving me to the next step and I would get an email within a week to schedule my next interview. I actually got the email the next day and scheduled it for August 6th (the first available date). This interview lasted about 45 minutes and is with a team manager.

It was not a difficult interview but very boring, and the interviewer was not engage. Her voice was very dull, and unclear, I couldn't catch what she said over the phone and had to ask her to repeat. I think she got mad after I asked her to repeat her questions several time. By the end of both interviews, both recruiter and the language vetting asked me if I have any question, I asked ""how many people are there in the team?"" But instead of answered my questions, they said ""I can't share this information with you, it's within Apple."" Well, I want to know more about the team that I maybe joining later, but it considered as ""confidential""? Then I guess there is no way to find out more about the team.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Apple was a company I was passionate about working for. From the feedback I’ve read here on Glassdoor and around the web it appears they treat their employees very well. The work is challenging, but rewarding and I wanted to be a part of a solid company that I could grow with. After putting in numerous applications I finally received my first call from Apple in April 2014 for AppleCare Technical (Tier 1) Chat Support. I was familiar with Apple products, but only owned a few of their gadgets. My tech support knowledge was limited, but I knew I could do the job with my dedication to learning new things. I needed a challenge and this was going to provide it. I studied my butt off to ensure I knew Apple inside and out and that definitely paid off. I managed to make it to the third/final interview and seemed to hit it off with each person I met with. Based on the conversation during my final interview I was confident I would get an offer. Long story short, it took about six weeks before I received the final word from my recruiter. For whatever reason, I didn’t get the job and my recruiter was very vague as to why. I was heart broken, but I absolutely enjoyed my experience during the process. Apple left me with a great impression of the company, even though I wasn’t offered a position. I vowed to reapply the following year if I were still interested. I did apply the following year, numerous times. The urge to work for Apple never ceased. I figured I had been blacklisted from previous applications, that I shamelessly created a new account on their career website with a revamped resume and cover letter just to have some fresh applications in the mix. After giving up on a call from Apple, I was contacted in June of 2015 for iTunes Chat Support. The recruiter I spoke with was extremely sweet and I was instantly moved on to the second interview. Although this was my second round with Apple, the position was more customer service based and for the iTunes Store which I wasn’t a frequent user of. I made sure to brush up on my knowledge. The second interview is where my passion for Apple went down the drain. First red flag of the interview was a late recruiter. No big deal right? I was still excited and super nervous. The recruiter I interviewed with clearly didn’t like their job, nor did they want to speak with me. I got the impression they didn’t bother reading my resume. Our interaction was extremely awkward. I’ve never felt so disrespected during an interview. The recruiter made snide/rude comments and appeared to not have much knowledge on the position beyond the written description on the website. According to this recruiter, watching the recruitment video on the career website was supposed to answer all my questions about working for Apple. I won’t go into further detail to expose whom this person is, but they should NOT be working for Apple. They did not embody what Apple strives to be. I really wanted to ask this person if they were okay and if there was a problem, but I was too afraid to do so. I really regret that now. I knew at the conclusion of the interview that I wasn’t going to be moved forward. The recruiter could have saved their fake enthusiasm at the end. I was a complete wreck once the cameras went off. Based on this experience I won’t reapply for a third shot, but it truly hurts that I didn’t get a shot at my dream job. Just like any recruitment office, there are some bad apples. I’m over it now, but I wanted to give folks some perspective.",Apple

A few technical questions (not super intensive, just analytical thinking mainly) and we did a role play. Kind of awkward but I got through it. Following, he gave me some constructive criticism (pretty cool right?) and then informed me that he was recommending me for the next step which was an onsite interview that I would self schedule. I received the email the following business day (which was a Monday) and scheduled my onsite interview for two days later (Wednesday). On the day of the on site interview I met with a different recruiter and she went over my history, asked me some customer service questions and then a few simple technical questions. Nothing to be intimidated by. They definitely gauge your skill level before asking. She informed me at the conclusion that HR would review all notes from both interviews and that I would hear something within the next two weeks and if I didn't I should contact my initial recruiter. Later that day, I received a phone call from the recruiter I had my FaceTime interview with informing me that they wanted to move forward and offer me the position (pending a criminal background check and drug screen).

All were low-key and straight forward. Most questions were about experience and skills listed on my resume, but there were a smattering of technical questions as well. The onsite technical interview was took most of the day (10:45 - 5:00pm). All in all there were seven rounds including the lunchtime chat with the manager. The coding questions ran the gambit from relatively easy to somewhat difficult, but all were totally reasonable. I never felt too rushed or pressured while writing code on the whiteboard.

Whatever questions I had was replied with ""I can't disclose that information"". I don't understand what the point of asking me If I had any questions was, if you're not going to answer anything.

 How would you select the datum for a particular design and what's the worst case stack-up.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I sent in my resume through a former colleague who is now working in the group I am applying to. It took them 5 month to contact me but once it started rolling, it went fast. After the initial phone screen with the HR, I had another phone call with the hiring manager. There were questions regarding my experience and some engineering fundamentals. The next day I was notified by the HR that the senior manager would like to have another phone interview one day after. Still the same question as the last one so I think he just want to double check before spending the money to bring me onsite. The next day the HR told me I will receive a design challenge and have 2 weeks to finish it. I submitted the design package on the Monday of the week which they invited me onsite. I flew coast-to-coast so they allowed me to stay a night before the interview. On the interview I had seven 1-on-1s and one 2-on-1, followed by a presentation introducing my design challenge work to about 15 people. The interview went from 9am non-stop all the way to 4pm. I was only offered a cup of water during the day. I was brought to lunch by the former colleague but it was another interview with bunch of technical questions so I wasn't able to eat well. Fortunately I took a bottle of juice, which was a life saver. They would escrow the candidate (me) to bathrooms and have someone peeing with me... which is kinda silly. After the onsite interview the hiring manager told me I could expect to hear from them before the weekend but actually it took them two more weeks to tell me that though they think I am good, they felt there's mismatch between my skill set and their expectation. The HR told me he recommended me to another group within Apple and the HR from that group will contact me if they are hiring. Not surprisingly, I never heard from that group. One thing makes the experience a little bit unpleasant was that I used about two months to chase the trip coordinator for my per diem reimbursement. I almost felt they did not intend to reimburse me.",Apple

The next day I got an email inviting me to a group interview the next week. At this interview in NYC Headquarters we were interviewed in a group of 5 with one interviewer. The interview was very quick (maybe 20 minutes). She showed us a video about working at Apple and what we thought of it and what were some things we liked about it. She asked various questions and we went around the table and each were given an opportunity to answer in any order we chose. After that I got an email a few days later inviting me to interview at one of the stores with the managers there. The next week I interviewed one-on-three at the store with two store managers and one HR recruiter. Overall, the questions weren't too difficult.

Then I had a one on one interview with the GM and he told me that he would like for me to meet the market leader (district manager) the next week. I got a phone call changing the in person interview to a phone interview and then another call a day later informing me that now the interview would be in person. I interviewed alongside another guy with the market leader. I was contacted 3 days later requesting I come in to fill out new hire paperwork. The questions asked ALL pertained to how personable I am and how adept I am at providing exceptional customer service. ZERO technical questions. I would only consider this interview process difficult because I had to go through 4 interviews and it took about a month. The questions aren't hard if you have what it takes (which is just being a kind, open individual). DO NOT go into Apple expecting to get the job because you know everything about the tech.

 Why Apple?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied online. The process was very tedious but I think it just depends on the store's situation. I attended a Hiring Event 2.5 weeks after applying. It consisted of about 30 other applicants. The store leaders show a power point, they do some ice breaker activities, and answer any questions anyone has. They break you into groups and you answer standard interview questions among the other applicants in your group. The store leaders walk around and observe. At the end they explained the next steps to the process. Basically an email stating you didn't get it but to keep trying or a phone call inviting you to the next step. Two weeks later I was invited to an interview with a store manager and two other applicants. This was easy peasy as long as you're comfortable and well spoken. For me, it felt more like a conversation than an interview. Two weeks later I was invited back for a group interview with a store leader, a market leader, and the same two applicants from the previous interview. As far as I know, the interview with the market leader is typically the final interview. Again, it seemed more like a conversation. Almost a month later, I received an invitation to come talk with the store leader of the Apple Store that I wanted to work at. A few days later I was offered a position over the phone. I think mostly everyone starts as a specialist. If you're reading this and are waiting to hear back from an interview, I would say that no news is good news.

I was contacted by a recruiter and set up for an initial phone screen. The phone screen was mostly about my previous work interspersed with technical questions on or related to things I had worked on. I could make out that the guy interviewing me was smart and had a broad knowledge of concepts in computer vision and machine learning, which were my areas of specialization. He mentioned that I would be called in for an on-site interview. Soon after this I received an offer from another company (during Christmas/New year holiday time frame) and I tried to reach out to Apple if they could speed up the process. I received a response from them after the holidays and had to quickly set up the on-site within a span of 3 days. The process was smooth with booking travel etc. on the Apple website. Most of the interviews went well except for the coding question, which did not quite work out in my favor. It was a simple question on implementing a += operator on a special data structure in BASE 100. Other interviews were mostly on my background and technical knowledge in computer vision and machine learning, which went pretty well in my opinion. However, I did not make it and my guess is the coding interview--you probably cannot be less than 100% to get into Apple. I did not hear back from them. Not sure how much may other offer played into their decision. Oh well!",Apple

 What would my current employer say about me?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Very low key interview. It was me and two other interviewees and two managers.

 See above. Many questions about my customer service experiences.   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"First was the group interview. Emphasis was on working as part of a team. Clearly just a filtering device - separate wheat from chaff. After that two interviews with store managers - friendly, chatty. Then the store leader interview. There was some confusion about what time the interview was to start; perhaps that set things off course. Lots of questions relating to my passion for Apple products, how I first came to Apple products, why I wanted to leave my current job, the usual questions . The air seemed to go out the of the interview. Then the phone call - they decided to move forward with other candidates whose backgrounds were more closely suited to the job.

" They ask you personal questions, just to make sure you're a nice person.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"The interview process for Apple is different for everyone. I know people who had a series of ten interviews over the course of six months, and people who were hired on the spot. Being referred is the easiest way to get in the door. I was referred by a friend and called in for an interview the next day. This was a very informal twenty minute chat with one of the general managers about what I liked to do, what I went to school for, the most influential people in my life, etc. They are mainly checking to make sure you are a nice person who is willing to learn, not if you know everything about every product (they would probably prefer to teach you themselves anyway). After that interview, they asked me to stay and speak with the store leader immediately, which was pretty unusual. The store leader talked to me for about five minutes before offering me the job on the spot. I told him I couldn't leave my previous job without giving two week notice, which he said he respected but that it would put me back in my interview process. I had to wait about three more weeks until they called me in for my third interview, this time with the district manager, store leader, and one general manager.

After I completed the background check Monday April 13th I received a call Thursday April 17th that I completed the background check and would start May 18th.

I received another call in January of 2015 and went through an initial question process. They asked simple things like ""How fast is your internet?, Can you provide a decent chair and desk?"". I passed the first screening and was passed onto the second round of screening, a Skype interview and an information session. I got all dressed up and waited for my Skype interview, the interviewer was almost 10 minutes late. It was a very casual interview, the interviewer was wearing a hoodie and a ball cap in what was clearly his living room. I could have probably gotten away with only wearing a collared shirt and not a suit but it is better to err on the side of safety. It was the most casual interview I have ever been in. The evening after the interview they required me to attend an online information webinar. It explained the benefits, requirements and was basically a job description in webinar form. There was a time for questions and answers. A week an a half later I got a offer, it was a terrible offer. It was less than what I am currently making and terrible vacation options. I did not take the offer. If I had to give one tip: Be honest with the interviewer, he doesn't want you tiptoeing around answers because you feel he may not like them. He commented on my frank honesty at the end of the interview and I think it helped me get an offer.",Apple

The phone interview is quick, maybe 10 minutes, and the interviewer just asks if you're still interested in the position, a few quick questions about your resume, etc. If you pass the quick phone interview, they schedule a longer video interview. This is quite a bit more in depth, and it takes place with 2 interviewers. There are the usual ""what would you do"" and ""how would you handle"" questions, and there is a typing test to see how quickly you type and how you handle a test chat. If you pass that, there is a third and final interview that is more of a welcome interview than anything else. This one basically guarantees you got the job.

Then the second step is with managers. I had two managers sit in and they asked me for examples that pertain to sales. I was over qualified for the position so I didn't get the job I also felt I was a bit too old as I walked out I inspected the group of people that would have been the department and everyone was at least 20 years younger and mostly male.

They just want to see who you are and what your social skills are. It's very casual. (I suggest nice blue jeans and a nice top.) From there, we played an introduction game called ""connection"" just to get us acquainted with one another and to loosen us up. About 3 people talked briefly about Apple and then we broke off into smaller groups to do role play scenarios. Just be cool and casual, and don't worry if you're nervous. Everyone else is too! After that, we passed an iPad around and answered some questions. Nothing too intense, again they just want to see the type of person you are. After that, you all go home and await the next call. The next interview I interviewed together with another girl. It was very casual and I didn't feel any pressure at all. Really let your personality come out in these interviews. A couple days later I was called in for my 3rd interview. I talked with the store leader and another manager. I answered questions just like every interview before. Finally, I got a call for the final interview with 3 managers and the hiring supervisor. I was with 2 other people and these questions got a little bit harder, but they never grilled us. It was always a very loving environment. Though it was an extensive process, I liked all of the interviews because if I bombed one I could make it up in another. They take your nervousness into consideration and are very kind. I got a call 2 days later with an offer and began training a week later. I love Apple and all the benefits!

Once they decided I got the job, I got an unofficial email, and then a week later I got the actual offer followed by a physical letter in the mail the next day.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online and was contacted within a week or two by a recruiter. The recruiters were very helpful and kind, but I didn't get the same feeling from the team I interviewed with. I had an initial skype interview with my would-be manager, who asked a long series of questions spanning analog design, low-level programming, and DSP (I'm a EE). After the initial interview, I was given a programming assignment to complete on my own and had a follow-up interview with the group manager. Both engineers I spoke to were very short and gave me the feeling that they didn't have time to talk to me. After multiple interviews, I was given a very gentle ""no"" by the recruiter.",Apple

Then, we were split up into groups of 9 and answered prompted questions with an iPad (basically all of the questions are situational) I talked maybe 3-4 in the 2 hour hiring event, but was asked back for another interview. Like other people have said before me, they are looking for a type of person. The managers will tell you straight-up that they are looking for nice, intelligent people. Show them that you are relatable and can get along with almost anyone AND show them that you are paying attention to the people in your group. For the final interview, I was 1 of 4 interviewees. Again, we were asked more situational questions. The same day as my final interview, I was emailed that I needed to complete my Apple application.

Then they broke us into groups of 4-5 people. Then the representative passes an iPad each person takes a turn answering a question and passes it to the next, they're mostly behavioral questions though I got a technical as well (not relating to apple products). Each of us answered 3 questions each. At the end representative asked a general question and each took turns answering it. Then you get a chance to ask the representative a question. Then the groups break up and return to the previous setting, a representative gives the closing statements and then we were dismissed.",Apple

I applied online through Apple.com/jobs and was contacted about 2 weeks later by a recruiting agent. This call lasted about 7 min or so. From that call they schedule a more in depth Facetime or Skype interview with a hiring manager. If you do not have access to facetime or skype you do have the option to have a phone interview. We scheduled the interview a week from that day. This interview was very interesting to me because ive never done an interview through a webcam before but it was very cool. The individual who interviewed me was a very nice young woman, she asked general questions about customer service experience and a couple certain instances where you helped someone or disagreed with something and how you repaired the situation. Also, we did about 3 roll playing scenarios. They are not difficult tech questions, they are looking for you to be empathetic to the customer and then try to figure out the solution to their problem. Just be calm and have fun with it, if you have ever helped a friend or family member figure something out just channel that. Be yourself and dont try to answer like a robot. Have personality, that is what they are looking for. So that interview lasted about 45 min. She told me I would be contacted in about 2 weeks to determine whether or not I move on to the third interview. 2 days later I received an email to schedule the third interview.

You can be more engaging with the interviewer. Its more personal. Better connection. So this next interview was scheduled again, 1 week from the day. Now, this interview was with a team manager who is the person or type of person who will be in charge of you when you are actually working. This interview lasted about 30 min. Again, alot of experience questions on how you are able to deal with people and situations you have dealt with in the past. Have a few stories ready to go so you are not caught off guard. Dont memorize a script just know the ins and outs of your story so you sound natural telling it. At the end of this interview, I was told id here about the decision in 2 weeks.

The interviewer asked me if I had any questions about the job so many times--even after he told me I wasn't a good fit. I don't understand why he wasn't upfront about the purpose of the phone call in the first place since it clearly wasn't an interview. He didn't take the time to get to know me at all.

 Have you ever had a disagreement with a someone above you and how was it resolved?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Been through the interview process a few time with two different markets. I've been to three hiring seminars, big groups often held in a hotel ballroom. Everyone introduces themselves, they show a presentation, and then break into groups. They look for those who stand out and have knowledge of the company. During the group interview is when they ask more customer service based questions that involve Apple products. I believe this is where you can shine the most if you're well versed with Apple products. Every time I went to a hiring seminar I got a callback for a store interview. The callbacks depend on the store, I always received mine within 24 hours of the seminar. If you make it past the first store interview there's still a few more interviews to go through before you get to the offer.

My first impression was that there were a lot of people interested in working for apple. The first introduction questions were very light. We watched a couple of videos then got divided into a table of 6-8 people. The managers from every store location were onsite. After a pool of 120+ people from the hiring event, I was called back for a second interview. This was broken down to maybe 18 people but was interviewed 6 people at a time. These were more specific questions on the ability to work with dissatisfied customers. The interview lasted only 20 minutes. They said that they would let me know a week later. I just received a call yesterday for my third interview. The experience was great and very light. I liked the fact that they are more interested on your people skills more than your experience however you have to understand the business aspect of apples goals to be able to relate to what they are trying to attain.

I recently finished the group interview which had around 20 applicants. It started by having each applicant introduce themselves including their background and what they're passionate about. From there they show several videos about what it's like to work for Apple and after each there's a discussion on things that you noticed from the video and how service from Apple is different from other retail stores. Next they split us up into two groups and they had us pass around an iPad with different interview questions that we answer in front of the entire group. Expect four interview questions each and then one group question which is basically asking why you would make a good Apple employee.

They give you a call first and talk to you about if you are still interested in the position.

You will then schedule an interview on either facetime or skype (your choice) and they are pretty flexible when it comes to scheduling it around your availability. The first facetime/skype interview takes about 30 minutes and you will talk to the Apple recruiter about customer service background and technical savvy. If they like you then you will be moved onto a facetime/skype interview with the hiring manager. This last interview is very much like the first one with a heavier concentration on the customer support end of things.

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"This was easily the hardest interview process I have been through in my life. From what I understand, the first interview is in a group setting with anywhere from 3 people to 100 people. This is where the weed a majority of the applicants out. I was lucky enough to have a referral, so I wasn't required to take this interview. Interview number 2 was with a hiring coordinator. She took me around the corner to a Starbucks, and it was essentially a conversation, not really an interview. The second interview lasted about 30 minutes. From there, the third interview, which I was also lucky to get immediately after the second interview, was with the Store Lead. Once again, this interview was held at the Starbucks and was very casual. After the third interview, I was told I would hear from them via email (saying thanks for the interest, but we've decided to move forward with different candidates) or a phone call to set up an additional interview. Lucky for me, about 2 hours after my third interview I got a phone call asking me to come in the next day for a fourth interview with the District Manager, this was also a group interview, being me and 2 other candidates. If you make it to the last interview, you're in. This was the most casual of the 4 interviews and from the start you could tell it was a ""get to know you session.""

Skype call, the interviewer asked many questions regarding my customer service experience, technical experiences, and did a role-play scenario. Some of the questions were a little to difficult to answer especially when you're on the spot, but it is definitely manageable.

 How Did you deal with an irate customer and turn the situation around?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"This was my third time around in through the hiring events. The first I made it through group and 1 interview. Second I did not get elected for a one on one interview. The most recent event was a group of about 15 which made me very confident because the other groups were 70+. One weird thing is that the event was at a store about 30 miles from my house when the store I applied to is about 8 but they assured me it was for the closer store. When I was called for the hiring event I had a short phone interview just asking a couple easy questions about job history and why I want to work for Apple. During the group stage it was fairly easy to stand out and see what kind of person they were looking for. The group interview is about 1hr and has presentations and pass and go questions. Just try and be honest and show that you listen well and smile! That night I was called for an interview the next day and I accepted. I showed up early as always and they let me know I was the first of the day so I waited till two guys came out and we went outside and spoke a bit about situational problems and how I resolved them. They were both very nice and easy to connect with and they let me know that some one would get back to me in about a week to let me know if I did or did not get the job. The interview was mostly composed of situational questions again and the occasional tangent here and there. This was one of the most nerve racking steps because I did not hear anything back for about two weeks. After sending a thank you email the day after the interview and a touch base email a week and a half after not hearing back, I was finally called back. The manager called me again to offer another interview. The interview took place a couple days after and this time it was just a one on one with a very nice lady. Again the interview consisted of situational questions and they seemed to overlap some of the other ones I had before but I did not mind. She let me know again after the interview that someone would get back to me by the end of the week(I interviewed on Tuesday). Again it took a while more to hear back, after being glued to my phone till the end of the week I received an e mail on Tuesday of the next week asking me to fill out the rest of my application. I did not want to get too exited at this point so I filled it out immediately and e mailed the manager that I did so. The very next day in the morning I got a call and he made me and offer over the phone, and I very happily accepted! He let me know that the offer was pending a clean background check. About a week after I was called back saying everything looked good and I just needed to go to the store to fill out some paperwork. Training starts in about 3 weeks and I could not be any happier to start with a company! The whole process took about 1+ month.",Apple

The manager informed us that she was unsure of how many positions were open at the time and that she would get back to us all individually on whether or not we made it to the second interview. I was called by an apple specialist the next day and asked to come in the following day for another interview. At the second interview I arrived at the apple store 10 minutes early and waited for the interviewer. When I finally met him he said that there was another potential candidate hiring at the same time. All 3 of us went to a nearby coffee store and we were asked questions by the interviewer. Some of the questions were Why do you want to work at apple? What is your favorite apple product? and what is an obstacle you have had to overcome recently? Unfortunately the next day I received an email stating that I was not called back for another interview however the whole process was very positive and and educational experience. The only part that was somewhat intimidating was the difference in candidates in the second interview. I am young to be applying for a job at apple and it was intimidating to be interviewing with a much older more experience person however I definitely learned from it.",Apple

After both interviews Apple paid to fly me out to Cupertino for a day of on-site interviews. The onsite interviews were all 2-on-1 style with varying members of the team and others that heavily work with the team. Each onsite interviewer seemed unprepared, disinterested, or both. It felt like I was interviewing for a different position than what was described to me over the phone interviews. Having interviewed with Apple five years previous to this, it was dismaying to see their recruitment process largely unchanged despite numerous flaws that eat into Apple's manpower and finances. If you do not get an interview with the VP of the organization, you do not get the job. It was noted on my itinerary before flying out that I was going to interview with someone high up at the Infinite Loop campus, but that did not happen as the recruiter said it was due to scheduling conflicts, which I did not believe.

From there I was asked to fill out an application online, and from there I was called with an offer at $16/hour, conditional on a background check. The biggest thing I found prior to interviewing was to stay positive when talking to them. They asked about what Apple products I own, why Apple, my own customer service experiences and how they'd relate to Apple, what I do for personal development. I read prior to my interviews to not be afraid to use the same scenarios with each separate interviewer - and I found that extremely helpful since I felt like I could basically put my story on repeat when I kept going back for more in-person interviews.

" Most questions were about handling difficult customers, receiving feedback from managers, and just general customer service experience.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"An employee submitted a referral for me with my resume many months ago. I got a call in early June for an interview, which totally surprised me! The interview was at my local Apple store and there was a group of about 10 applicants. There were two employees who explained everything about the process, talked about the company and roles and basically just discussed how everything would go. We were given a sheet of paper where you put availability, store preference, roles, and any other comments. They divided us into 2 groups for the actual interview part. The interviewer had an iPad and she just chose random questions and we answered by raising our hands in no particular order. Questions were about customer service experience, how you handled difficult situations, how you handled criticism from a boss, etc. Typical questions. We turned in the papers and they said they would contact us soon. I got a call the next day for another interview the following day. This interview was one-on-one and he asked the same kind of questions as before. Nothing difficult at all. It was extremely casual, we were just sitting outside talking. He told me to come back in a couple days for another interview with his boss. That interview was supposed to be a group interview, but the other applicant was late, so he started without them. It was the same customer service questions, really easy. Make sure you have questions to ask your interviewers at the end. After this interview, he told me his boss was out of town, but I'd get a call the following week to schedule it. This was where the process kind of stalled. About a week later, I got a call to schedule the interview, but the time didn't work for me. I played phone tag with the scheduler until she finally called me back a few days later with a time that worked for everyone and the interview was for the next week. The final interview was with the store leader, essentially the district manager, who gives the final say. It was me and one other candidate at this interview. He talked about himself and asked the usual questions. At the end, he said we could hear from that coming Monday. I waited until Monday and heard nothing. I got an e-mail on Sunday evening asking me to apply for the position online (I never did because I got an employee referral). About a week after this e-mail, I finally got a call with an offer! They asked me about my salary history, which was small because I had only 2 jobs before. They made a verbal offer and I accepted! You will get an e-mail to do a background check after this before you go any further. I think my interview process took longer because of managers being out-of-town and some employees were being changed around, but overall it was easy and fun.",Apple

 What's your favorite electronic device that's not an apple product?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Got an email from a random Apple email address about being invited to their 'Apple Retail Hiring Event'. The interview was the typical group interview. Thought I spoke quite frequently and answered all the questions correctly (a lot of people ignored the questions and just talked up the Apple Products). Then went into a small group interview where my group had to answer questions. My group was all very eager to speak which got a little difficult. Two people interviewing the group seemed uninterested in what we were having to say. Left the interview feeling I did the best that I could, but unfortunately I did not get the position. Overall It was a good experience.",Apple

Interviewed with 8 people back to back for 4 hours. Overall, the people were friendly, however I found the overall climate / personality of the locations not a good fit for me.

 No hard questions.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"My friend submitted my resume internally and right after that I got contacted by the recruiter. We emailed and spoke on the phone.

I did not hear back for a couple of weeks so I emailed the recruiter and she answered that another candidate was chosen for the position. She did mention that the feedback from my interview was positive and that she would be happy to help me pursue other opportunities at Apple.

 How would you describe RAM to a person that has no idea what it is?   ,Accepted Offer,Average Interview,,I applied through the Apple website.

,Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"Was recruited from another retail location. Bypassed hiring event, which is where new applicants meet with current employees and try to ""stand out"" by exhibiting behaviors etc that coincide with what is sought by Apple Retail. Went into interviews with managers outside the store over coffee. First manager was a sales floor manager, then on to a Senior Manager, then Store leader, then Market Leader, then Store Leader again. Long process, but all were very nice and funny and intriguing in and of themselves, they were sure to make it clear we were having conversations, not just grilling me with questions. Be prepared to have questions to ask them that are thought provoking. Eventually got the job offer via phone call. Be sure to put an emphasis on customer focus and team development. Don't worry as much about sales numbers and bragging about how much of whatever you sold. Said to me by the Market Leader...""We're just looking for people who can talk to people, you can't change who someone is. I can teach you everything you need to know about the technology, but I can't teach you to be someone you're not.""",Apple

 Why Apple?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was an internal candidate so I reached out to my manager to let the recruiting manager know I was interested. I then set up a time to meet with seven total managers for a panel interview. I was interviewed by two Store Leaders, three Senior Managers and two other Managers.

He asked about my current position and why did I fit with their position. At the end of the call he also explained about his two job openings. I had two onsite interviews. One was Full day, and the other was half day. The full day inteview was tough. Every half an hour a new person would come in and almost none of them had read my resume so I had to go over all my experiences and education. Questions were both about my experience and personal. The second day was more technical. Interviews were so frustrating I must say. I would say out of 10 people whom I saw 7 of them were constantly looking at their cell phones and were distracted. But all of the people whom interviewed me were so nice and reasonable. Next day after the second interview I got a call from the reruiter to discuss my salary and I was told that I'm being hired.

 Describe the difference between Bluetooth and Wireless. I stumbled over that one....   ,No Offer,,,"Applied online on a Thursday morning, got a call THAT afternoon. Was invited for a second interview, which was scheduled for the next Monday. That was a FT interview with a second recruiter, and I learned via an email message the next day that I would be moving on to the 3rd interview. Hoorah! The message included a link to schedule the 3rd,with interview opportunities as soon as two days from them - the next Thursday. But - I was going to be out of the country starting that day and for the next week and a half. I emailed the recruiters involved explaining the situation, and eventually got a message from a higher up that said, basically 'safe travels, we'll do this when you get back.' So then I am indeed out of the country and one day start to see a series of missed calls from CA. Then I answer a call - it's the second recruiter asking if I am still interested in the position? I explained yes, but I thought everyone was clear that I was unavailable until the next week? That night, after another round of messaging with the 'safe travels' recruiter, I was finally told that I was confirmed for a 3rd interview the Monday following my return at 10AM EST (although all other interviews are scheduled for CST?). That day came and went with no call. Huh? I messaged everyone involved about a possible mix up in the time? Heard back from exactly NO one - zero. So, I went back to the message with the link to schedule your own 3rd interview and found that, indeed, I cold still do that, and I set up one for the next day. That time came, and I did get the FT interview. Alas, two days later, I got the dreaded email message that they had decided to move on with 'other candidates'. Crash! My wife thinks I should have tried to schedule the 3rd while we were out of the country and that I lost momentum by putting it off. In retrospect, I think she may be right. That whole 'confirmed 3rd interview at 10 AM EST' with the subsequent no interview was very strange. I have re-applied twice, and have heard nothing back. Oh well. Time to move on.",Apple

For the on-campus interview, I was asked product design questions such as how you would manufacture a perfect sphere, how I would redesign Apple device components, what components they showed me were made of and how they were made, how I would redesign a project I had already completed. I brought a portfolio which I think helped my case, though they tore me apart on every decision I made in past projects. Overall it was a very intense experience with 7 interviews back to back culminating in a presentation of their design challenge, where they really grilled me. If you don't know the answer, say ""I don't know."" Don't BS Apple interviewers otherwise you'll talk yourself into a hole.

The questions were not extremely tough but makes you think in terms of DS and Algorithms. The lunch turned out to be a very technical interview in itself but now the entire team is shooting questions at you. Overall, it was a good learning experience.

 What makes you different from the literal thousands of applicants that apply to Apple?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,Interviewed at Apple. The process took 5 weeks. I applied through an employee referral. I went into the store on 3 different occasions to familiarize myself with some of the managers.

I submitted portfolio samples, code samples, and style samples. In the end I didn't get the job and it might have been because of the frustration that I was feeling in the last few weeks before the decision . It came down to two of us and they picked the other person. But I think that 6 months is WAY too long to decide a job position. for the main reason that there were 3 or 4 other positions that came along at Apple during this process that I applied for but was passed over because they had me listed 'In Process' for the other job. 2 of the other jobs were almost exactly the same position as the one that I was applying for.",Apple

 Describe a time you overcommitted or couldn't alone accomplish a task assigned to you and how you handled the situation.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"This was definitely a “different” interview process. I made it past the hiring event and then to an additional two interviews before being cut. The first was the hiring event. First we introduce a person next to us, and then watch some videos and comment on them. We then passed around an iPad that cycled through random interview questions. We swiped to a new question, read it aloud and answered it. The questions were very standard interview questions that you will find all over the internet. I had applied to be a genius, but received a call inviting me to interview one-on-one to be a business specialist. The interview was somewhat conversational and semi-formal in nature, but not completely lax. After the initial hiring event, questions become more based on things they heard you say during the hiring event, things on your resume, or things that just flow from the interview conversation. A few days later I was called and asked to interview with the head of the family room specialist team. The interview was one-on-three. I received an email later that day informing me that they chose to go with another candidate. Seeing how I applied to be a genius, interviewed as a business specialist and then a family room specialist it is clear that Apple is primarily concerned with finding the right individuals -then- fitting them to a positing or training them into a position.

Finally, I had a call with a more senior manager in the team I joined. His questioning went a little deeper, but was still pretty much the expected stuff.

There was a lot of interviews to go through, 4 or 5 in total I think, but every time I met with someone different, and never felt like I was being strung along.

 Why would you be a good fit for this position?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Attended a hiring event 4 weeks ago with a group of 20 people. As most of the candidates posted on this website, they start with an ice breaker and introduction. We were asked to name our favorite App. I think the whole process is the stand out and pay attention to what your fellow candidates are saying. They played different videos that talk about the varied roles Apple has to offer in their retail stores. A lot of the same people raised their hands to answer questions after viewing each video. I personally did not do this, but any time somebody spoke I would give them undivided attention and not look distracted. We were divided up into smaller groups of 5 and passed around an iPad with several questions that we could chose from. Making eye contact while answering these questions is key. If the managers liked your answers, they would follow it up with other questions to find out more. I felt the hiring event went very well and each candidate was given adequate time to answer their questions. Do not hog all the managers time. A week later I received a phone call for my first real interview with a manager. The interview was very laid back. I felt like a friend was asking me about my current job, so my answers were really detailed and natural. One week later I was called to schedule a second interview with another manager. This interview pretty much mirrored the first. One question was even the same. Again, they are really laid back so just feed off of that same energy and you will be fine. This second interview went so well that I was asked to hang around for my third interview with the store manager (45 mins after). This was more of a meeting were we talked about company expectations. We talked about Full time vs part time and flexibility. At the end of my meeting I scheduled my 4th and final interview with the area manager. This interview was over the phone and again was very much about personality and talking about your background and how it fits well with Apple. I immediately was sent an email request for a background check.",Apple

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I had one phone review followed by two in-person interviews. All three were relatively casual. The first was to get a basic understanding of me and why I would like to, and why I think I would be a great fit for working for Apple. The second interview (in person) was to meet the store manager and was told to dress in what I normally wear. I think this interview was to see my personality. I think Apple (retail especially) cares the most about personality than experience. They even say themselves that you can train people to teach them things like product knowledge and how they want you to promote and sell a product, but you can’t change someone’s personality.

Shortly after being referred I was called in for an in-person interview at the store. The interview lasted about 30 minutes and was just as much a personal conversation. Typical interview questions were asked, along with some personal questions inquiring about my experiences abroad during postgraduate study. The interview went very well as the manager and I were cheerful throughout, exchanging laughs and healthy conversation. I was told I would hear back approximately within a week about information regarding the next step of the hiring process, regardless of whether I would continue on to another interview. Unfortunately this information never came as I patiently waited. After I patiently waited for four weeks I contacted the store to speak to the manager who had interviewed me. I was given an apology and assurance that I would receive information within 24 hours about my applicant status. It was very upsetting to find out 5 days after this phone call that I would not progress to another interview but instead was turned down. My colleague had informed me that if I had not heard back from Apple within a few weeks, that it certainly was not a bad thing since Apple is very committed to informing applicants of their status post-interview. A separate colleague whom works at the store I was interviewing for informed me that new hires had been brought on during the time I was waiting for a reply. All of this combined with the apology I received from the manager has led me to believe that I was perhaps not provided an opportunity to work for Apple due to a mishandling of my application.",Apple

 Describe a time when you had an angry customer call in an wouldn't work with you to resolve the concern.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Applied online and received a phone call with in 2 weeks. This was the first interview done with a first line recruiter. I was told about the position, about when the training classes would begin and asked if I would be available by then. Since this was at the end of the year my interviews took place in November but training would not begin until January, which is not typical. Usually your training will start within 1-2 weeks after your offer is accepted. The first interview with the recruiter was about 10 minutes. They asked me about my experience in customer service, my experience with Apple products and how I felt I would do working from home with a remote team and management. The second interview was with an HR representative. This interview was more about what the position entailed, what the benefits were, and what total compensation included such as salary, benefits, employee discounts and 401k/stock options etc. They also asked some behavioral interviewing questions such as ""describe a time when you had a difficult customer call in and how you worked with them to positively resolve their concerns"". The third and final interview us done over FaceTime or Skype if you don't have an Apple product, with a hiring manager. Not necessarily the person that will be your manager, but a team manager pin your skill set (phone, chat, iOS, Mac etc). This interview goes into a little more technical detail about how to troubleshoot, how cellular technology works, what you would do if you didn't know the answer to the customer'so questions etc. My advice to you is to be yourself first and foremost. Be personable and engaging, avoid short answers and try to be robust giving as much information as possible. If you do not know the answer to the question they are asking, be up front and say you do not know but follow that through by explaining how you would go about finding the answers. It is always best to be honest than to try to answer the question incorrectly. For example when I was asked how I would troubleshoot something I had never even heard of, I told the interviewer that I didn't know what that was, but I was sure I would be trained on it in training. Chow ever, if I were confronted with this situation while on the job I would follow the established troubleshooting protocol including using the tools provided to me by the company for looking up troubleshooting processes, asking team members for assistance or escalating the call to the next tier of support so that the customer could be assisted in a timely manner and I could learn from that agent how to handle the situation properly. My best advice to you, outside of being yourself and honest, is to think about ""a time when"" situations before the interviews. Write out the details about a time when you had an angry customer, a difficult customer, a time when you didn't know the answer, a time when you got frustrated because the troubleshooting wasn't working etc. this way you don't have a lot of uncomfortable silence while you're trying to think about an example especially because you're going to be on a video conference. Dress appropriately for an interview and be aware of what is in the background of the room you're interviewing in. It also helps if you're in a quiet place, free of distractions, turn off TVs, computers phones etc., put pets outside or close the door and keep other background noise to a minimum. You may be interviewing for an at home position, but you are still interviewing for a professional position with a world leader in customer service!",Apple

They were on a fast track to hire (I could feel the momentum) and I was told that I would have gotten an offer but they changed the job description significantly at the end of the process. They stayed in touch and wanted to find a different role for me but were in the midst of a reorg and I accepted another job before the dust settled there.,Apple

Close to Thanksgiving- so assumed it would take them a bit to get back to me- 2 emails and a call later still no word from the recruiter. I'm ok with there being no interest but it's just plain rude to not even respond. I get that Apple can call the shots because of their cool brand and interest in working there, but it's just disrespectful to not even close out the candidate? That lack of tact and common courtesy is what is off putting...the team seemed great and lots to do- but is that really the culture- or just how the talent acquisition team works? Either way a bit dissapointing that they just leave candidates hanging- regardless of fit or interest. Negative rating due to experience w/the recruiter not the hiring managers and others I met.

,Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I re-contacted an Apple recruiter who contacted me in the past because I was looking for new opportunities. After sorting out the location, I got two phone interviews. I got quite basic C++ and algorithm questions. After those two interviews, I was invited for a round of interviews at the Cupertino office. I had 4-5 interviews back to back with no breaks. I really appreciated having to meet 2-3 engineers during each interview. It is actually a good ice breaker. The questions I got were difficult but quite manageable if you came prepared.",Apple

 Describe a past difficult experience with a co-worker/team and how you resolved the situation?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Application is straight forward through the company's own online recruiting portal. They hire based not only on aptitude, but also attitude, which is why I applied for the position without having previous experience in the field. That being said, it naturally helps to have an understanding of the products being sold and being passionate about serving customers. 1st Interview is usually a group interview as described in other posts, 2nd interview is in a smaller group setting with the recruiter and the hiring team's lead manager and a 3rd interview is conducted with the store manager. All three interviews are fairly casual (dress code business casual although that is a lose definition, I got through with jeans and a nice shirt and coat combo, don't wear a tie, you'll be overdressed). Questions vary from technical (naming products, describing services) to past experience (good and bad experiences with customers etc.). I think I blew my third interview on the following question ""describe a past difficult experience with a co-worker/team and how you resolved the situation"". Now I'm an agreeable person and never had any issues worth mentioning so I struggled to answer and just babbled about difficulties coordinating to meet deadlines, which was a rather weak response. So do come prepared with an answer for standard interview questions like that, I got caught off guard on this one, hopefully this review will help you do better.",Apple

 I a customer's Iphone is having trouble with email (won't receive or send emails) how would you help the customer troubleshoot?   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"The interviewing was pretty easy. I initially signed up for a Skype interview, but since Skype was seeming to malfunction (big surprise) Apple just decided to call me for the interview. I talked to a very encouraging and friendly lady for about 20 minutes. She explained everything about the position, asked a few questions, and accepted questions with a very polite attitude. I've never been so comfortable for an interview. She asked things like what is RAM, hard drive, and a processor. Also, she asked what was my experience with Apple prodcuts (which was only ipods and ipads fyi), and she also gave me situations and asked how I would help the customer troubleshoot their product. Overall, the questions weren't as difficult as I expected. To be honest, I am definitely no tech expert. My answers for the RAM hard drive processor question was: the RAM deals with memory and it determines how much a computer can process, the hard drive is the storage system for the computer, the processor is like the engine of the computer and it determines how smooth it runs. I swear to god, I felt like I was pulling the BS right out of my butt. But, she said I had excellent answers. Anyway, it was a pretty lax, and easy interview.",Apple

After this hiring event, I heard back the day after via phone for a 2nd interview which is a panel interview. This one was with 3 or 4 of different store leaders and market leaders. This one is definitely more serious and formal than the first one. Here, they ask you 'what separates you from other candidates?"" etc. After this interview, I received a phone call about a week later for my final interview with the store leader.

But that was my experience and I feel I got wrong person on other side of the phone.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I was contacted by an Apple recruiter through LinkedIn and had first telephonic interview where I was asked technical questions about my work experience. It was thoroughly professional and started on time. I cleared this round and was asked for second telephonic round. I kept waiting for the call, and interviewer who was an Indian guy called me 20 minutes late. He had no questions to ask. So he started by asking me about how was my round 1 and made me repeat those answers. In 5 minutes he asked me if I had any questions and interview was over in 12 minutes. Perhaps he was not interested or he had some other plans for the day. After sending 3 emails, I finally received reply from the HR that they are not going ahead with me.",Apple
 Why do you want to work at Apple?   ,No Offer,Difficult Interview,,"Interview process is long and arduous it consists of 3 rounds the first one being a group interview, second being initial manager interview, and third being regional manager interview.

I think they understood that I didn't know all of their secrets, but wanted to see if they could train me.",Apple
" Basically, all the questions in the group interview section were awful. There were not hard or trick questions, but instead the opposite; extremely open-ended and mysterious.

" In the first 5 minutes of the first interview, the manager described the store and the company as a cult.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Expect to be interviewed multiple times, stretching over weeks or even months. Your interview is the first indoctrination to Apple culture, and you are being made to think that every decision is very carefully considered before it is executed and you're hired. It's not. The ""group interview"" portion helps them compare your performance in a crowd, and perceive you as a customer might when walking into their store.

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Applied online. Sent in a resume and thought out cover letter and was asked about 2 weeks later to come in for a hiring event. After dressing business casual and making my appearance to the event, there were about 25 others there, many of who showed up in unprofessional attire. This almost put a bad taste in my mouth, but I just felt an advantage right away. After watching a few small video clips about the company (Apple), we were asked what the most surprising thing was that we just learned. Then after, we were moved into groups, where we were asked general questions, mainly about customer service experience. They say it's optional to answer, but why would you go to a job interview and not answer questions. They log down what you say and they judge you from there. After this event, which lasted almost two hours, I was asked a week later to come in for a second one on one interview. I was told that only 3 out of the group were asked to come in for this. It was a pretty relaxed interview with the team leader just walking around the store as he asked me general customer service questions and answering questions about myself. I found out halfway through talking with the team leader at the store that they were only hiring for the sales position. I was pretty disappointed with the fact that the team leader wasn't even aware of the cover letter I took the time to create and that I applied for the creative position. I think they just bring in anyone who generally applies to the store and assume they just want the general sales position, but you have to start somewhere I guess. The 1 on 1 interview lasted for about 45 minutes, thought it went very well, but was informed that they went ahead with their hiring of others. Somewhat glad I didn't get it because it opened my eyes to the Apple culture. Felt it was Apple or nothing there, but that's the way it is when you're working to promote any company.",Apple

Questions at lunch were harder (about debug information and data structures). Another interview then was harder, about reverse-post order and very detailed coding questions. Atmosphere is ok, but compared to other companies a little bit arrogant (e.g. ""you forgot a semicolon there""). Biggest turn off was that interview got cut short, manager came and said they need somebody with LLVM experience, even though this was never in my resume, and he knew from the phone interviews that I've never worked at LLVM.

 None were difficult.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Approached online via LinkedIn from a Recruiter about the position. Didn't get too much information other than a very high level paragraph about the position. Responded back with my resume. About two day later I received a phone call requesting to setup a phone interview with the hiring manager. Based on my schedule, I agreed upon a date and time range. This all happened pretty quickly, about 3 days later I had a phone interview with the hiring manager. That interview was very basic, the hiring manager asked if I knew about the position, I explained the info I was provided with was very high level. He then actually provided me with the job details in full, still seemed to be something I was well qualified for. The interview was then abruptly cut short, I was in the middle of explaining why I think this would be a good position for me when he simple said, ""OK thank you, I'll speak with the recruiter"" and ended the call. The interview up to now had been very basic, your text book interview questions. I thought that was it and maybe he didn't think too much of me. To my surprise the next day I received an email and two voice mails about following up for a in person interview. I finally was able to contact back the recruiter later that day, was a busy day for me, and we again scheduled something based on my schedule. It was left pretty open as far as when this would actually occur. I think was contacted by email from another person who had singled out the day of the interview. This happened about two days after the recruiter and I spoke about the in person interview. Finally the night before the interview I had received all information, including the people I was to interview with, and a schedule. I was to meet on site with 6 people and each would interview me for about 30 minutes. I arrived to the location, signed in, met with the hiring manager first. He asked me pretty much the same questions from the phone interview. His attention seemed to be moved over to emails and texts messages from time to time. The process with him was very basic questions. I then met with another 3 people, a total of 4 of the 6 I was supposed to meet with. The interview questions were very basic, they started asking more questions about the software I'm currently working with than the actual position. There were a few interruptions with their attention being focuses else where, people coming in, and so on. It made for a tough time to sell yourself as some of the people I interviewed with seemed to be focused on emails, chats, and so forth. I didn't get the feeling that they were too interested when I was told the other two people I was going to meet with where not going to meet with me. So I left the site about an hour earlier than scheduled. I was contacted via the recruiter two days later, via email, that I was not a fit but everyone enjoyed meeting with me.",Apple

" Listing off different software that Apple offers. I use all Apple products and grew up with them, but I kind of drew a blank, not expecting them to want a list of five different Apple apps that are built in to your phone.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I initially applied online to the Walden Galleria Apple store in Buffalo, New York. I had no connections with anyone working there. I was invited to a hiring event that happened off site in a conference room upstairs in the mall. There were about 30 people there. I was pretty quiet during the big group portion, but during the smaller group session, when they asked the people at our table to answer questions I answered in such a way that kept everyones attention. They have current employees sit in at the tables and listen in to your answers, but they are more focused on your demeanor, how you are in front of people, and if you are articulate. It was pretty intimidating. Then I got called back the next day for an interview with one of the managers. That interview went well and was pretty straight forward. It was interesting because they really just seemed to want to get to know me as a person and weren't focused as much on my technical knowledge. The second interview was more based on technical knowledge. They told me to work on that. I was convinced I wouldn't get a call back, but I did. So I went for the fourth and final interview. It seems like a lot for a retail position but all of the interviews were pretty comfortable. The fourth one was with the store manager and the district leader. It was pretty intimidating because the store manager was very cold and distant and didn't say much. The district manager was very nice and made me feel at ease. So it was a weird combination to adjust to. Kind of like good cop bad cop. It was hard to read that interview because I felt like the district manage wanted me on board, but the store manager didn't seem as excited.",Apple
" Seems like if you dont ask questions you get rejected, if you do, you get rejected. The interviewers came off very pretentious.   ",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Was a group interview that really didn't give much input to the interviewers about the people that were there because it was basically them telling us how wonderful Apple and the work environment is. They never actually looked at my resume, so whats the point? Probably filling demographic quotas just to say they filled them. One thing that stood out was that they told everyone that we were all hand picked specifically to be at the event and we should feel privileged, the funny part about that was I had filled out the online app at the Apple Jobs website probably like 5 years ago because the invite came to an email I havent used since then, but it just so happened to get forwarded to my new one because I set it up that way. So when I saw it, I said what the hell I'll go and humor myself. So when talking to a few other attendees, 3 out of the five people I talked to had referrals from people already working in the Apple store, and the others said they had just filled out an app about 2 weeks prior. The reason why I know they never pay attention to you or your resume is that I had gotten a rejection email to the same old address, even though everything I had filled out at the hiring event, and the info I have on my resume stated my new information.",Apple

 A man calls in and has an older computer that is essentially a brick. What do you do?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied on-line to work at home for Apple part-time. I had a total of three interviews, starting with a brief phone interview, and two via webcam. The initial interviewer was very warm and brief and just wanted to feel out my technical experience. I was honest in that I have no troubleshooting experience but do have a technical degree and had worked in software development. She gave me some pointers on areas to focus on for the next interview which happened a few days later. The second interviewer was less warm but still generally nice, with an undercurrent of irritation. His questions chiefly involved explaining the parts of a computer to non-technical folks (which they seem to assume have a very minimal intelligence). Hint - do not refer to the hard drive as storage for your computer. This set him off the most. Think as simplistically as you can when you answer these questions, as if you are talking to a very small child. Practice these answers thoughtfully. Also read your Apple manuals as I was asked to walk him through setting the passcode on my Iphone without looking at it (which seems easy but isn't when your nervous). The third interviewer was very warm. At this point I had worked up some fear and he was patient and kind. I was led to believe that this interviewer would focus on my customer service background, unfortunately for me this interview was solely technical and pretty much blew me out of the water. When interviewing for this job know how to troubleshoot across platforms and know your Apple device(s). Do not assume, as I did, that this info would be covered in training. Know how to get a dead computer running. Know how to determine which area of the computer might be affected. And remember that you must explain these things as simply as possible. Do not overestimate your abilities in this area because any weaknesses you have will be quickly seen through. Overall the experience was a positive one. Interviewing for Apple was something I never expected I would be able to do, so I am very glad I had the opportunity. I would do it again, but with WAY more preparation.",Apple
 General technical questions about manufacturing and materials   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Met with manager and a handful of project leads and interviewed for most of the morning and afternoon. The technical questions weren't necessarily hard (what is this made out of? how did we make it? name 5 other ways we can make this, etc.), but I wasn't confident in my answers. I wasn't great at talking through the problems, and I was underprepared and to an extent unprepared for the interview, not only in terms of technical foundation, but also a solid design portfolio that I could present and defend when asked to go into greater detail. Nothing gets passed by these guys, and I have a ton of respect for everyone in the PD groups. I was grilled pretty hard, and it was hard not to take personally, but they were just making sure they're getting the absolute best people. Overall, a tough experience but a lot of great takeaways moving forward.",Apple

Next was a couple phone interviews that went extremely well. The people I talked to were extremely friendly and very well prepared for the interview process. When I went in person, I felt everyone was extremely friendly, accommodating, and knew what they were doing. I did not get the job as they said I was ""Technically proficient, but too Junior"".

It is important to pay attention to the films because the questions asked later will not be exactly the way the film presented them but rather more of did you catch the concept being communicated.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"The initial interview is a rather unique group setting where you watch several films and answer questions about the company based on the fils - and a few trivia questions as well. Then you are divided into smaller groups where each person gets to pick from a list of questions and respond to the group. This is nice because it lets you put your best foot forward. If they like you, they will call you in for a one on one interview with a store manager. There are more questions of the type answered in the smaller group on the first interview as well as just talking. It is very relaxed and personal.",Apple

,Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Overall Apple is known to take a very long time in their hiring process so just hang tight, and be prepared to do that for a while. They take forever to figure out who they want to hire, which is the waiting game, but once they decide its like a rocket took off. They go hyper speed in getting you trained and into the position as fast as possible, so also be prepaid for that. They generally are looking for someone who is passionate about their products, not just some genius who likes to use them. They are about people first, and then product knowledge, etc. They want good people because good people cannot be taught, but skills on the other hand can be so keep that in mind. You might know it all and have every qualification out there, but to Apple that doesn't matter, because who likes to work with someone difficult, know-it-all, nonbeliever, or so forth. Keep your head held high and don't ever give up, my biggest piece of advice is to be PERSISTENT!!! That advice is not just for this job but for all of them. If you were the boss and you had to choose between two people, one of which had been showing much more interest in the position (persistence), you would most likely choose that person over the other.

 Design an LED driver using an op-amp   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I've interviewed on two separate occasions for hardware positions with Apple.

If you're not selected (which I wasn't) they just leave you hanging. At first I thought it was just an lazy recruiter, but the second time it happened I realized that it must be a policy to not contact you or respond in any way if you are not chosen. Not a way to leave a good impression; after wasting time with them on the phone multiple times and taking time off to interview in person with them I don't think it is too much to ask for a form email letter to let you know you weren't selected (if their competitors can do it, I think Apple can as well).

"If you're applying for the Expert role, you will face two rounds: competency and technical knowledge. They competency part is all about you, your readiness for the role, etc. The thing about interviewing at Apple is you might thing you're applying for one thing, but then they offer you something totally different. They strive to fit you in the best role possible. The questions in the competency section often start",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"It was long. First I met with the People Leader and a Senior Manager. Then I met with the Store Leader. Then I met with the Market Leader. Then I had to travel 150 miles to go to an Expert Panel Interview. There I met with three Store Leaders and a Lead Genius. After that, I met with yet another Manager, the Family Room Manager, who gave his input on the final decision. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. But at the same time, it was really enlightening. Interviewing at Apple is all about storytelling. Tell a story about you, be compelling, show that you're passionate. It's more than just loving Apple, it's about being interesting. Also, with respect to the Expert position, it was perhaps a tad more difficult because I was being hired externally. Plus, not everyone I interviewed with absolutely loved me. That's okay, not everyone will. Luckily, I made enough of an impression that people fought for me. In my work I proved them right. I love Apple, and hopefully if you're applying there it's because you do as well, not just because it's a cool place to work. Still, I left because of the one thing that I couldn't help: in Apple Retail, there is currently very, very limited opportunity for long-term advancement. Therefore, buyer beware. It's not just any job, but it's not a career either (well, no longer, anyway). It's a bloody shame. This was written in November of 2012.",Apple

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied about three months ago and just got an email about two weeks ago.

Then I was given a choice to answer questions about a Mac, or a PC. I Know more about the PC, but I choose Mac because I wanted challenge.

 Why do you want to work here.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"My friend who works at Apple submitted my application online (which already puts you ahead of the game). If you slightly know anyone who works there I would recommend you ask them to submit your resume because it's better for you, and they get a bonus if you're hired. Before getting an interview, I went into the store 3 times to introduce myself to some of the managers. The third time I went in, I met with the Senior Manager (#2 in the store) who asked me on the spot if we could do my first interview. I hadn't prepared myself for that, but I went along and did it. A lot of the questions were like ""tell me about a time when you had a conflict with another employee and how did you handle it"" ""when was there a time when you gave management feedback?"" ""how to you bring your own creativity into work?"" It helps if you think of the answers to questions like this before you go in so you're not stumbling through the interview. A few days later, I got a call to interview with another manager. This time, there was a lot of chit chat before the actual interview started. They want to see that you can strike up an interesting conversation with people without knowing them. After these two interviews, I was only half way done. I met with the store leader a week later. We talked a lot about music and traveling more than we did about the position. One question they always ask at the end is ""Do you have any questions for me"" ALWAYS ASK A QUESTION!! It shows your sincerely interested. My last interview was with one other potential candidate and the Market Leader who over looks 5 stores. It was questions about our personal lives like relationships, stress with money and school... We both ended up getting the job!

,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"The hiring event I attended lasted for two hours and there were 24 candidates in the room. In two days they were looking at about 150 candidates for four stores. In addition to the head recruiter who stood up front and led the session, there were at least ten other Apple people in the room armed with clipboards taking notes. To start off the session the head recruiter showed some Apple videos that gave stats about Apple's success. Take notes! There is a verbal quiz! They are looking for people who can recall the number of stores worldwide, or sales for 2010. They also broke the group into pairs.I had a few minutes to get to know my partner and then introduce him to the group.Alternatively, he had to do the same. My advice: figure out the key messages about yourself you want your partner to remember and then tell him in a very clear and concise way so he can remember the key points. Following this exercise, there were additional opportunities to ""add your two cents"" to the presentation by raising your hand and getting called on to add comments about a question he posed. For example, ""what is your favorite iPhone app and why?"" This type of back and forth went on for a while until we were split into groups of six and taken out into the hallway with two people from Apple still armed with clipboards. Again, this was so weird because questions were posed to the group and either you had to jump in to answer a question or, they went around the circle and everyone answered the same question. Both of the Apple people were taking notes. We then went back into the room, sat down and they said ""Thanks very much, we will be in touch as early as this afternoon."" Bottom line, I have no idea what they were looking for. No one in the room had more experience with Apple products than I did. In fact, some only owed an iPod. Somehow that did not matter. They are looking for a ""type"" that I wish I could explain to you here, but I can't since I am not sure who got called back for round 2. I did not move forward in the process. I am a 60 year old woman who has been using and loving Apple products since 1990, the year most of the people in that room were born! I figured that it was worth a try to see if they would hire me to work with some of their customers who may be intimidated by the hip, young Specialists who dominate the scene at the typical Apple store. When I received the ""sorry to say"" email my husband's comment was ""after a month when the novelty wears off, you would hate it."" Maybe he is right. Maybe not. In the meantime, I remain a loyal Apple customer.",Apple

,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Group interview, single manager interview, then an orientation. The interviews were fun and relaxing and also very educational. It also depends on the managers you get too. Sometimes you may have a really cool laid back person with a great personality and other times you may get a person that's straight down to business. but no matter what just come in dress casual but professional and don't try to impress. They can smell phony from a mile. It helps that if you are full of tattoos, facial piercings, and sporting a mohawk to be as professional in demeanor as possible. they love individuality as long as you can be professional.",Apple

 Role play scenarios   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I attended the hiring event at the mall. It occurred from 7 PM to approximately 10 PM. There were at least 50 applicants. Employees dressed casually. Some employees wore sandals and shorts. Two of the women employees were very attractive. We were asked to complete a form and name tags. The first thing that transpired were introductions. Everyone had to say their name, why he/she would be a good fit for the company, and a fun fact about themselves. The man sitting adjacent to me actually wrote on a card what he was going to say. When I saw this, I almost burst out laughing. The next thing was a presentation about the company that entailed a video, information about each position, and various Apple products. Then, there were role play scenarios. This was the arduous aspect of the hiring event. You are given multiple situations, and you had to act the role of an Apple employee. For example, one scenario was when a customer wanted to know about upcoming items. Another example is when a customer wants to know why the wait in line was too long. You had to react to those situations. On the Apple site, it conspicuously states, ""You don’t necessarily have to be an Apple expert"" in order to be hired. That is a fabrication. You must know about the products in order to proceed to the next step in the hiring process. I was misled into thinking this was a casual interview because the email I received from the manager was aloof. If you want advice, I would advocate you make yourself unique and distinguishable from the other applicants. You absolutely must prepare for various customer service scenarios. That is your interview. Moreover, you should go to an Apple store to see the different customer service scenarios. The final part was a Q and A session. A woman actually asked about the flexibility with the schedule. When she asked that asinine question, everyone in the room laughed at her (including myself). One employee admitted he only one took one semester of college; thus, education is something the company has absolutely no interest in. The one thing that stood out was that people were arbitrarily clapping. Someone would say their name, and people would start clapping and yelling. It was vexing and painful to hear. After the hiring event, it was fairly odd trying to exit. Since the mall closed prior to the hiring event, all applicants were escorted through the back emergency exit. Many of the applicants has to walk 3 miles just to get back to their cars because we had to take convoluted exits that led elsewhere. There are ways to be professional and casual simultaneously (Google has done this to perfection). The next day, I received a rejection email from the manager. I am a PC and proud of it.",Apple

Meaning find out what you need to, be friendly to that person (just because you're not talking to the interviewer doesn't mean you're not being interviewed; they are watching). When you talk, stand up and introduce that person, present it; don't just read a card with their info. Then they invite you to a group activity, where you have a fake person, they give you a barebones info about her/him, then you get to explore her/his life by asking questions, and in the end find out what her/his needs are.

 Typical question: What are my weaknesses.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Overall, a very positive experience. Was interviewing for a Manager position in the marketing group. Over two full days, I interviewed with 28 people. Most of it was a conversational style interview to assess not only skills, but a culture fit. The recruiter, the group director, and all of the staff were a pleasure to meet with. They were intelligent, articulate, and clearly took pride in the work they were doing. The long interviews were rigorous, but nothing out of left field. The Apple recruiter and I both felt that the culture was right on both sides (mine and theirs) but that the position wasn't a perfect match for my skill set. They have been in touch again, so I know I'm still active in their files.",Apple
,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"Approached by recruiter after submitting resume online. Had a phone call with a manager followed by 2 back to back video interviews consisting of questions about my past work, and a couple of programming assignments at the end. Questions were strictly technical and focused on relevant experience only, skipping over those which didn't apply to the position I was interviewing for. Feedback was good and I was invited for on-site interviews. Surprisingly just a week later I was told they hired someone else and the interview stands canceled. I was very disappointed. I wouldn't say the experience was negative, as the interviewers and my recruiter were friendly and to-the-point. Recruiter still assured me they're looking for other open positions but nothing worked out and I gave up after 2 months.",Apple
,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"An Apple recruiter contacted me and invited me to ""interview"" with Apple. Turned out to be a group interview with about 20 other people. As we entered the room, we were applauded by the Apple Managers and then had to mingle with each other for about 15 minutes. After a presentation on how great Apple was, all the Managers introduced themselves, and told us what they wanted to be when they were little. Then we had to introduce the person sitting next to us. We were then split into groups of 6 and had to give a presentation to the group while all the Apple Managers furiously took notes. Got an email back from the recruiter and invited me back for the second round of interviews. This interview consisted of two panel interviews with five different people and another candidate. It was interesting to hear another candidate answer interview questions, but was kind of awkward for us to answer the exact same questions right after each other. The entire process left me feeling rushed and unable to really connect with any one person.",Apple

Then they break the large group (in my case 50+ people) into smaller groups in which you have 20 minutes to prepare a presentation on any apple product. The entire time the managers are walking around with clipboards taking notes and observing the groups. Then the group must present to the managers and the entire pool of applicants. Once this is over, there is a Q&A session then everyone leaves. They ask you to not email them and insist that they will contact you if you are picked.

,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I have not yet finished the process-- I found a job posting for my local Apple store, and the link to click on brought me to the Apple website to submit a cover letter and a resume. I was sent a text message maybe a couple of weeks later, asking me to call. I called and spoke to a person who asked a few simple questions (not relating to experience, just factual type questions), then I received an email a few days later inviting me to a recruiting event. There were about 20 candidates. 4 or 5 Apple employees helped with the presentation and answering questions. I thought the presentation, a video which showed things about the company, the products, the stores, the employees, etc. was very good. We were asked questions, so it was interactive. We were divided into 4 groups and each group was to do a presentation to illustrate one of Apple's products. We were told that Apple only hires about 1 in 20 applicants. They explained that if we were invited to interview, there would be four interview, each done by a different person. I was called two days later for my first interview, and at the end of the interview was asked if I would be available that day for a second interview. So I went to my second interview. It appears that I will be asked for a third interview. They asked questions about various circumstances you may have had in previous jobs and how you handled them. Also so hypothetical questions. Their main interest, it appears, is that you have the right customer service attitude because for Apple it's about creating the experience for the customer, meeting their needs, and enhancing their lives in some way. The second interview did ask some product knowledge questions. I felt comfortable answering ""I don't know"" when I didn't. I am looking forward to my third interview, and I hope a fourth.",Apple
" Describe a time when a customer's response was not what you expected it to be, and how were you able to align with the customer and reset their expectation?   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"Initially, I applied online for a new store position within the area. I was contacted by a recruiter about a month later asking if I would be interested in a phone interview. The phone interview lasted for about 30-40 minutes, and was fairly relaxed. It was mainly to understand my personality and why I wanted to work for Apple. At the end of the interview, I was told that they believed I would be a good fit for the company, but not in the role I applied for. I applied for a ""Specialist"" position, which is the general sales force. They believed that I would be a much better fit for the ""Family Room Specialist"" position, which is basic-level tech support for iPhones, iPods and iPads. I was contacted a few weeks later asking if I would like to interview for the position in person, and providing details as to location. When I arrived at the hotel where the interviews were being held, the recruiter immediately welcomed me and asked me to sit in the lobby for a few minutes while they wrap up the previous interviews. A second person was interviewing at the same time as me, in another room. The interview was split with half of the management team in each room, and interviewing (panel style) with both sides for 30 minutes. This interview process was more directed, but still casual. The panels asked questions about my previous work experience, and how I handled certain situations. They did not ask any questions about technical experience or knowledge and focused entirely on what I said to customers and what their reactions were. After the interview was completed, I was advised that I would be contacted in the next few months with more information. After 2 months, I was contacted and offered a job as a Family Room Specialist. It took another month before training started, and I was on the payroll.",Apple

Since the apple store doesn't know until 24 hours before Steve Jobs, does an announcement, there's no way to be able to accurately tell someone.

I guess you could say, what was expected in the ""interview,"" if you could call it that, is not demonstrated in the stores. I mean most of them were nice kids and everything, but I figured out more about the product from 3 minutes of fiddling with it than they seemed to know in store.

I was also told that though you were not discouraged to take vacation time, there really was no opportunity to do so. Questions consisted of how have I stopped a line in the past, could I give examples with out giving out proprietary information, and how would how customers use a product influence the recommendations I would make for testing during development. There was also a belief by the interviewers that the job was very different from anything I have ever done but it really wasn't. Lastly they wanted to know what questions I had about Apple.

But when we broke out into smaller groups I think I made an impression on one of the managers who was watching from afar. I wasn't sure I would get a call back for a second interview, but I did about a week later. I met with a manager from the Cambridge store to which I was applying. He was really nice, we chatted a bit about life, and got to the questions - Why do you want to work for Apple? When you previously worked in retail, did you ever have to deal with an unhappy customer? How did you deal with them? Tell me how you would sell one of our products. What programs are you familiar with? What makes iPhoto so special? Tell me how you would differ from other employees, how you would stand out in my store. After the interview, I asked him how he got started with Apple and what his experience was like. At the end, he gave me a sheet of paper with instructions on it and told me the next step before the next interview would be a video. That's right - a video. Using iMovie. Answering the question ""Why would you be a great addition to the Apple team?"" I had 36 hours to email it in. So I wrote a song. I played guitar and sang, and had two of my friends play percussion. It was actually a whole lot of fun. I got another call about a week and a half later from another manager at the Cambridge store who wanted to set me up with my (his words) ""hopefully final interview"". Hopefully? C'mon. I sang you guys an awesome song. Just hire me already! He had already filled positions for interviews that day, told me he would call me back the following day. I didn't hear from him again for about another week. By this time I already had other interviews lined up and I lost a lot of enthusiasm for this position. But I scheduled my final interview anyway - it wasn't for another week. I had already come this far, I might as well see if they offer me the position. Meanwhile, I received an email from an Apple recruiter to fill out the online form for a background check. Wasn't worried about that at all. I also received an email from a manager from a New Hampshire store inviting me to their hiring seminar. That was kind of annoying.

It was supposed to be an Apple advertisement that somehow related to an object that the group had decided to choose. Ours was a chapstick. Ended with a ""we'll call you"" or let you know.",Apple
 What were your recent experiences in a retail industry when a customer was unhappy with the store and what did you do to appease them?   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I was contacted by phone and informed that I had a interview at the local Apple store after posting on their site. I was told to wear casual clothes. I wore jeans and a polo and felt a little over dressed. If you have been to an Apple store before then you know how they dress. Jeans and a t-shirt at best. I got there and was waiting in the interview line when all of a sudden two guys came out and told us that it would be a group interview. All five of the interviewees and the two interviewers went to the nearby Food Court and grabbed a table. It seemed pretty informal. They told us about the company and what to expect if hired. They started asking questions mostly about customer service. What are your recent experiences with an angry customer? Tell us your experiences with blah blah blah in the customer service industry. Tell us about previous jobs you have had in customer service and sales. This is where I messed up. I have not worked for a store in retail so I did not have many ""experiences"" to talk about. Overall, I don't think that you would have to know an iPod from a Zune to work at the Apple Store in sales. I was expecting to have a lot more technical questions but I guess they think that they could teach a monkey the product line but it takes someone with experience to please the customers. I thought that it was a good experience. I would recommend having another sales job before interviewing so that you can tell some stories at the interview. We were also told at the beginning and end of the interview that it takes an average of 6 interview attempts to get hired and that acceptance rates at ivy league colleges are higher than the Apple Store.",Apple

Towards the end we were placed in groups and given scenarios in which we had to sell Apple products to a certain type of person. Once again participation is key. Brush up on your Apple knowledge before coming. Nothing too crazy just general things. It looks impressive if you know what you're talking about. A few hours after the seminar I got a call to schedule a 1-1 interview that was 2 days later. The interview lasted about 30 minutes and I was in a room with 3 other managers. Question wise, they asked typical interview questions such as past job experience, difficult situations in dealing with customers, teamwork, and so on. It's important to give personality to your answers as that's very important to the company. Crack a few jokes if that's your thing (it certainly helped me). Overall make sure you're comfortable and try to have a conversation with the interviewer as opposed to just answering questions. Finally, make sure to ask them questions about their job.

None of the questions were too out-of-the-box, but it seemed like a great fit. I was scheduled for one more set of interviews - the peer panel, which occurred a week later. The peer reviews were very poorly run - the two peer panel interviewers seemed to be completely unprepared about my background and were disorganized. My questions were specific and caught them off-guard. I suspect this was potentially due to the secretive culture at Apple. They made no attempt to really understand what my background was. After this conversation, the HR manager sent me a note telling me that they were very interested in having me come for in-person interviews, and would let me know within a week, but that communication never happened, despite my repeated attempts to reach out.

Anyway, he took me to a rest area in the mall and we went over my employment history, why I wanted to work for Apple, experience with Apple products, etc. Interview lasted about 30-40 minutes and the guy was blown away by me. Basically...dress nice and convince the guy/girl/group that you LOVE Apple and there is NO PLACE else you'd rather work (without coming off as fake).

" Find the frequency response of a two stage, coupled RC network   ",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Initially, I was contacted after the hiring manager was given my resume. A quick face to face interview was arranged for the same day with the hiring manager, as well as one of the technologists in the group. Both went very well, and I was asked to come back for a full day interview. The first several individuals I talked with asked intelligent, insightful questions about my experience, background, and managment style. I also was asked to teach some aspect of my technical experience to one of the interviewers, which went very well. The third interviewer was apparently the technical screen. He came into the interview room and immediately went to the white board with a rather obscure technical problem. I muddled through it with some occasional suggestions from the interviewer, who was texting on his iPhone the entire time, and got the right answer. The next problem problem that required a formula I hadn't encountered since college, so I described what I would do if I could remember the formula. He then impatiently jumped to the board and did the problem, and quickly excused himself outside the room. There, he proceeded to talk to either the hiring manager or the staffing employee so loudly about the interview that I could have heard it if I was deaf.

After that... if you're outgoing enough and you made an impression, you'll go home, wait a month or so with no notification only to get a random phone call in the middle of the night asking you to attend a group interview... usually at a Starbucks or some other public place. After this group interview, you go another month or so without hearing anything... and then out of nowhere, you either get a rejection letter, or an approval.

 How did I use interpersonal skills to lead a team of unmotivated individuals?   ,Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online at apple.com/jobs by sending in my resume. I was immediatly contacted by a recruiter in Los Angeles, CA. Apple had planned on opening a new retail store in Baton Rouge, LA and I had the skills they were looking for. I had 3 phone interviews. They were all pretty generic and basic, you know, just to get a feel. Then a month or so later I had a formal interview with two managers from the Houston, TX market. I was asked to give a ten minute presentation and submit a portfolio. The interveiw went extremely well. Another month went by, I was contacted again by the recruiter to set up an interview with the store manager of the new location. That was the most ackward interview I've ever been in. It was one on one. He was really odd. He'd ask me a question, I would answer it. Then he would answer the question using his own words, basically saying the same thing I just said, but acted as if my answer was wrong. I did not get the position I applied for. I was contacted by the recruiter and asked to apply for the Concierge position. At that time, I asked for another interview with someone else. I interviewed again with the store manager and the market manager of Tulsa, OK. I was offered the job for the position I wanted, but I would have had to relocate to Tulsa. I went through yet another interview, this time with the store manager an 2 assistant store managers. Two weeks later I was offered a position. I accepted. The entire process took about 4 months for me to actually start working. Three months of interviews, nine total and then waiting a month for my start date.",Apple

 When was a time you were an early adopter of a technology?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,,Apple
,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Very long interview process. Totally it lasted three months (waisted for me). First interview is a classic group interview held in an Hotel small meeting room. When you receive the invitation make sure to book ASAP because they ran out of spots pretty quickly and then you have to email them and ask to join that specific group for the specific time allotment you desire. For this first stage, prepare to be engaging, friendly, do not avoid eye contact, smile but without being fake. You will watch some boring stuff about how Green they are (really???) and recycling stuff. Use the info on the videos at your advantage to make some observation when requested at the end of the video. Always raise your hand before you start talking. the process was the following: brief personal introduction; group work (prepare small presentation on how excellent customer care is for you); 2 people scenario (you will play one time the specialist and another time the customer; you will be given a small scenario and will have to interact based on the info of the scenario); finally some questions. Stage 2 (after roughly 2 weeks) 4 people in a small room in the store: general question which I will post underneath this section. Again, be friendly and engage with anyone but without being intrusive. third stage after almost 3 weeks: last 4 people remained in total: again question that I will post underneath. Final stage: the ""offer stage"". I had the fear that the same thing that happened to a friend of mine few months before would have happened to me. And it did: i was asked if my availability was the same as it was in November??? (we are now in January) Me: Yes, except for 1 out of the 4 days, but if it is a problem I can try to make arrangements or if that is ok for you I can still work 4 days but pick up another one. I got told that in order to don't hurt my studies I would have been put you in their ""pipeline” and to not WORRY...WE WILL CALL YOU BACK. and you can imagine the rest. Sorry I couldn't keep it shorter. Just one advice. If you want to work in Apple, make sure you have another job (keep it) or if you don't currently have a job, keep looking for it even if Apple calls you and you do good in all the process, otherwise you will risk to have waisted 3 months like I did.",Apple

He passed the iPad to us individually and we all selected a number 1 at a time, when you pick the number, a question comes up. You then answer the question. I was interviewing with 2 other people. Basic interview questions for the most part. Once you get to level 5 and up is where the questions get tricky. ""Name a time where you helped someone in your business less fortunate than you."" I sadly feel like I got all the hard questions. But afterwards he asked if we had any questions. I had been reading that it's a good idea to ask a question like, ""What are the stores goals this year?"" Or ""What is something that you do daily that gives you a feeling of satisfaction."" He then told us we would receive a call if we were selected to proceed with the next interview. I received a call about 10 minutes out of the mall. He set me up with another interview 2 days later. I met with the district manager and general manager of the location I was applying to. It was me and a woman.

The question pops up on the screen and you have 20-30 seconds to prep for the question. It then begins recording you on your webcam..its like talking to yourself. You have 3 mins for each question.

 Tell us about yourself ?   ,Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"My interview process started on Nov 2015, and spanned till Mar 2016. The first stage was a phone screening where they look at how you converse and judge whether you’re worthy for further interview stages or not. I went through 3 additional interview processes (role-plays, individual interview sessions and ‘about me’ descriptions) after the phone screening and successfully cleared them all. I was updated on the final decision over the phone, but important questions held by any aspiring apple employee were left unanswered e.g.: When would I be joining the team? Ans. We’re sorry but we do not have a timeline, Could you give an approximate timeline? Ans. We’re sorry, we can’t give you a timeline, Could you at least give a written email mentioning that I’ve been successfully selected at Apple? Ans. We’re sorry we cannot do that. So you’re basically just left with a verbal confirmation to hold on to, which seems extremely unfair considering that major hours and efforts are put in by every individual giving the interviews, not forgetting the major amount of patience needed to keep up with 4+ interviews spanning over 5 months. What breaks the expectations one holds for an organization holding a stature such as that of Apple is that the responsible recruiters do not even respond to your phone calls or emails when asked for an update (which is not given in the first place). This kind of behavior towards potential apple employees is ruining the reputation of the organization and the morale one would hold before starting his/her employment with them. Till date I and other recruits have no solid date in hand and no assurance (been 6 months since the last interview) and don’t know if we’d ever be employed. My only message to the ME Apple management would be to avoid treating potential retail employees like crap, they are the actual face of your organization and the major stakeholders in the success factor of the Apple retail stores.",Apple

It was ridiculous. Obviously this is to test your social skills as Apple is big on that however, the first stage of an interview should be the basic interview questions, getting to know the applicant and learning of their job skills. It should not rely on the information that is learnt as the applicants talk with each other.

After the small group interview, I had one-on-one interview with a different manager. He then asked me to talk about myself. It was a very broad question, because in between small group interview the managers would take a break talk secretly outside who has potential. So.. I'm guessing the last manager interviewing heard all the things they have said. I started repeating everything from interview before. Lastly, they tell you they will give you a follow up email or phone call. I got an email a week later with the results. The group interview took about less than two hours. It's really hard process for an entry-level and very picky. Probably one of the most difficult jobs to get in. Everybody in my group interview had strong personalities. I knew alot about Apple products and have almost every product, but still didn't get in.",Apple

The interview was really just a bunch of employees just trying to pour the apple koolaid down everyones throat and see which potential candidates would jump up and down the fastest at an opportunity to work for apple. it's really quite ridiculous. it was more of a marketing stunt than an interview.

She didn't seem to know I was coming nor did she have my resume. Again the interview was comfortable and simple. A few weeks after that I was asked to come in for another interview with two other managers of the store. Again, nothing that hadn't come up in the last three interviews. They told me they were doing a background check through a third party company which could take a few weeks and that it might be a good idea for me to attend an Apple class so I can see how it all worked (no one ever mentioned it again). Almost two months later, after I had thought they had forgotten about me, I'm invited to an interview with the area marketing manager. Again, same questions, different person. I was already getting fed up with the whole thing when I got a call from someone at the store saying I had been put on a waiting list and someone would touch base with me in two weeks. Since this had no end in sight, and had taken up five months, I took another job else where.

Then we watched a short video on the business aspect of Apple, and afterward one of the 5 or 6 interviewers stood up and asked some general questions for us to answer (What makes Apple better than other retailers, etc.) After that we did a role play where we had to stand up with a card and act out the type of customer on said card, and the other had to pretend to be a specialist assisting us. After that came another video about Apple employees, and why they love working for Apple. I have to say, they do a good job of getting you excited to work there. After that there were a few more questions about the video (What words stood out, etc) and then there was a QA session where everyone got to ask any questions they had.

It did not have to be an Apple product, yet it seemed that everyone pulled some sort of Apple technology out of the bag, ranging from love of iPhones to Mac computers. A video was shown to give the applicants a basic understanding of their store layout and personnel functions.

 Introduce the person next to you   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online for an Apple Specialist position and was contacted via email to attend a private Apple career event held in one of the local Apple stores after hours.

After a brief introduction, they asked us to pair up with another applicant with the goal of introducing this former stranger to the group. There were a good number of presentations where it was obvious that the applicants were aspiring improv actors. I was unfortunately pretty nervous as I have never been very good at on-the-spot improvisational group presentations. After a quick series of inspirational videos, they passed out scenario cards and asked us to pair with our previous introduction partner. We had 10 minutes to put work on a quick 1 minute presentation by each partner. The topics varied from an angry customer to a prospective employee. The hardest part was trying to keep the presentation under a minute. All the while, the managers from the various stores looked on and took notes. After this, we had an opportunity to ask questions. We were told we would hear back via email within the week. I didn't an invite for a 2nd interview.",Apple

He was quite busy at the time I arrived. Talked with that manager for about one hour at an ice cream store nearby. Was told that they always interview people three times with different managers at their stores, before they will hire you. I think they passed on a third interview due to my not having any previous retail experience. Find something that you have done in the past that is a transferable skill from your past jobs, if you don't have sales experience. They want someone who can hit the ground running as far as sales are concerned. They claim that past sales experience is not necessary, but they really did not convince me of that one at all. I got a form turn down letter via email from the hiring manager, and it was worded verbatim with other form letters I have seen online, that Apple apparently sends out to those they have decided to pass on.

 Waarom wil je bij Apple werken?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Zeer slechte ervaring met solliciteren bij Apple. Eerst een Facetimegesprek gehad voor de functie 'Expert', dacht ik. Tijdens het gesprek bleek dat ze een technisch specialist zochten, wat niets voor mij bleek te zijn.

Na veel gebel en gemail eindelijk opnieuw uitgenodigd. De sollicitatie was een hele dag gesprekken voeren in een groep. Helaas krijg je dan niet echt de kans om te laten zien wie je bent.

Je reçus à nouveau un mail trois jours après plutôt, me signifiant que, retenu, je pouvais poursuivre la procédure. Dans le mail il y avait alors une invitation à un ""Entretien collectif"". Je me suis rendu à l'Entretien collectif une semaine plus tard donc et il s'agissait en effet d'une séance de deux heures avec une dizaine d'autres candidats. Nous étions (11), ""coachés"" les deux heures durant par deux agents Apple, recruteur et manager, sur les produits Apple et d'autres détails connexes. L'entretien collectif consiste en résumé à évaluer vos capacités d'écoute, de présence d'esprit, vos aptitudes sociales surtout, ressortir votre esprit d'équipe. C'est la personnalité qui est jugé et vous n'avez pas le temps de le remarquer. La meilleure option est alors de rester soi même. Ils le savent quand vous interprétez un rôle.
