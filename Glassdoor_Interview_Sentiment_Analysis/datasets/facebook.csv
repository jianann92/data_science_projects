The recruiter reached out to me and then asked me when we could connect. I sent her times and then she flopped. I followed up and she then agreed to a time to connect. The call started in a very interesting way. She was late a few minutes which was fine but then she started making assumptions about my background. She started with making statements discounting my background. She then mentioned I interviewed here multiple times before and I’m not qualified for the roles she recruits for and I’m better off supporting orgs like legal, hr etc as I don’t work in product. When I shared I do work in product analytics she then informed me that what I work on is not a real product(ads) because product is more about analytics for designing buttons etc. She then said my experience as a program manager was also not product and how Facebook refers to these as non product roles. I mentioned that I was never a program manager and a product manager and she said well it wasn’t real product. I was a little confused to why she was essentially attacking and undermining my experience with such strong bias. I then mentioned explicitly I worked on product at my previous company as well and at this point she mentioned that was 3 years ago and doesn’t count as she has better candidates suited for the job that have real product experience with years of experience. She then tried to sell me again the hr, legal analytics roles which I again expressed I had no interest. The conversation was very interesting and she didn’t stop there. She then made assumptions about how many people I manage and how I’m not really a manager. I emphasized I’m a manager of managers and she asked for my level at a larger competing company which I shared. She then said even though you are an L7 at Google our manager roles go up to L8 and those are senior managers and I mentioned that’s not correct L8 are directors as I have some friends that work there. She then stated that she has 3 roles only and of which are with managers who I’ve interviewed with before and they wouldn’t want to chat with me because based on my interview feedback I have various issues that deem me as unqualified for these roles.To be honest I’m not sure what the purpose of the call was after that statement but it felt like she had a tough day and was undermining my experience in any way possible. Why would you setup time for a call if you’ve reviewed my interviews saying I wasn’t fit. was a waste of my time and she was extremely rude. Extremely terrible experience. For context I had interviewed with the data engineering team a few months earlier and the recruiter there along with the leadership team I interviewed with were amazing.

The interviewer makes a difference in how the interview goes with respect to pace and follow up questions.

As a PM that spends more time getting to know the landscape and situation, I found it challenging to receive the questions to solve real time. I was thinking of cool ideas the rest of the day that I wish I’d had time to communicate in the interview. I’m much more likely and inclined to draw on stories and connections to work through problems than I am to make decisions alone.

No big deal. Happens all the time. Last week, another recruiter from Facebook hit me up for a data science job. I said ""Hey wait, my friend put me in for a similar position a couple of weeks ago. I think it'd be pretty unfair if he didn't have an opportunity to receive a referral bonus."" She reached out directly to my friend and asked him to submit my resume again for this Data Science position and then scheduled a call with me for today. A couple hours before our scheduled call, I received a rejection email akin to the one from a month ago. I replied to the recruiter who sent the rejection and said ""Hey wait, I have a call scheduled for this afternoon. What's going on?"" and she replied that there was a matter of a duplicate record. Then the original recruiter who had reached out to me totally ditched the call that we'd scheduled. I can handle the rejection. Again, happens all the time. They have something they're looking for and I'm not it. OK, no problem. But the absolute, total, incredible lack of professionalism from Facebook Recruiting is just embarrassing.

 Question about addressing experimentation as it relates to one of Facebook Products.   ,No Offer,"Taking an honest examination of my interview for the senior data scientist position at Facebook, I can strongly confirm the blatantly racial discrimination and bias. Facebook gives off this false illusion of wanting to be for everyone, and it’s not true in actuality. Not just Facebook, but all top tech companies discriminate systemically. I truly believe as a person of color, if you are not asian person of color, it is almost a waste of time interviewing at tech companies, especially Facebook. When you speak to the people that work at Facebook, they give off this special privilege mentality that make’s no sense. I interviewed with the hiring manager, and his disposition towards me was so bad that I wanted to just hang up. White-melanin people, who are actually the real minorities in the world because over 6.1 billion of the 7.7 billion world population is of darker melanin (black, dark brown, brown, light brown). To most people of white-melanin, it is very difficult for them to give us darker melanin people the benefit of the doubt. When interviewing, like at Facebook, it bothers people of white-melanin to see that we are educated and have experience or desires in lucrative fields. Fields being engineering, physics, science, and others. So when we appear on video chat, especially if our names aren’t vividly interpreted as being a person of darker melanin, they are very disappointed. You can see it because an interview on our end, on my end with Facebook I thought went well enough to do the job. Well enough is good enough, and that is where the benefit of the doubt comes in. There’s a learning component, and a continuation of learning on ALL jobs. An Facebook clearly tells you once you are hired for a Senior Data Scientist position, you are in a 90 day bootcamp learning how to do it Facebook way. So if you are willing to teach me what I will be doing, what I am expected to be doing, then what exactly are you looking for in the interview. I truly believe they are looking for white-melanin individuals 99.9% of the time. If Facebook is claiming to address the hiring of darker-melanin candidates, an if you are going to teach them what to do, and the candidate has a advanced degree like myself; Then most candidates you interview will have similar backgrounds, why wouldn’t you hire the under represented population? It’s no difference in hiring the white-melanin person because of their skin tone, because that’s why most of them are hired. The funny thing about this is that medical doctors have to learn things everyday, yet Facebook is willing to teach you how to do it, probably pay for continuing learning classes, you have an advanced degree, yet you don’t qualify to work at Facebook.

It's really sad to see how they treat potential candidates. If you are not even serious enough to show up for interviewing for a role which is perhaps a very important role considering Facebook's current situation then it sends a very bad message to future candidates. In addition, I was shocked to see one of my interviewers say, the only reason we have end-to-end encryption is to prevent investigators from asking us for PII data. If we have end-to-end encryption, we can just say, we don't have the data. Its got nothing to do with customer privacy but with Facebook's personal benefit",Negative Experience,Average Interview,Facebook

I then had a 45-minute technical phone interview with a Data Scientist Manager. One very easy SQL question, followed by about 30 minutes of just product analytics questions. I thought it went really well - the conversation went smoothly, good energy, I gave detailed answers and have product knowledge and enthusiasm from using the products myself. I was really excited about it, but then I just heard I didn't get past this round. Not sure why, I emailed asking for any feedback, but haven't heard yet. Red flags: the video aspect of the BlueJeans app didn't work, so we couldn't see each other; interviewer came off as slightly snobby and arrogant and told me she didn't read past the first page of my resume (I have a two-page resume, - I know there is debate about that, and I've heard cases made for either one-page or two-page, but now I'm strongly considering condensing mine to one page), but I guess they can afford to be that way, as they are facebook... (eye roll). Every time I've spoken with a Facebook data scientist in recent years, either in interviews or informally, there is a ""you're lucky to speak with me, I know I'm in a privileged position and I love holding that over your head"" vibe... not at all a humble stance or a sense that everyone has things to offer, not *only* people who work at Facebook. It's confusing to have a *technical* phone screen and to answer all the *technical* parts reasonably and correctly, and ... not make it to the next round, at which time rejection can be anything from personality fit to company needs.

He asked me some SQL questions and one hypothetical case regarding my favorite facebook product. (Don't take this round very lightly I have heard people getting rejected from this round as well). After that round, I was scheduled a skype round with the Data Science Manager which was divided into SQL query and product based questions. He gave me SQL queries to write, my queries were perfect but I didn't write an optimize query which was the problem. Don't write big queries try to write optimized queries. The product related questions were quite straight forward and I don't think they are looking for specific answers. So one can just practice some questions like how will you test the success of a product? Or What changes will you propose to make the product better, etc. I was asked the usage of the status updates has decreased so how will you test that thing?

" hypothetical questions, presentation and three rounds of 1:1   ",No Offer,"First round skype interview, then onsite. The process was very disrespectful and ignorant. You could 100% feel that the recruiter and the interviewers feel entitled themselves, and don't care about you at all and have little empathy on you as the interviewee. Ironically the position is user research which emphasizes on showing respect and empathy on users. So I doubt how empathetic FB user researchers can be for their users. First, for the first round, the HR hasn't contacted me after almost a month until I emailed her/him to know I got a positive feedback and moved to the next round. From the beginning to the end the recruiters are now responsive at all, you had to ask several times to gain one very brief and unclear answers from them. For the onsite, I was onsite at Menlo Park, but ironically 2 of the 3 interviewers are on video calls, with one actually at Menlo Park campus but just was unwilling to go to the building I was at. The onsite began with presentation. One interviewer was late, and obviously the recruiting team changed another interviewer without telling me and the rest of the interviewers, so we waited for someone who would never join the presentation. Also they booked the room with meetings before my interview, so another few minutes to letting people out before we could get in. BUT, all the late minutes counted to my presentation time, so the interviewers asked me to skip my intro slices and went directly to research projects. This largely changed my presentation flow, for the reasons that is not my fault at all. During the presentation, one interviewer kept on interrupting my presentation and asked me to go back several slices to ask his questions. So I went back and forth slices at least three times just to answer his questions, which further interrupt the flow. This was really unprofessional - he could ask the question when I was on the exact slice, or simply wait till the end to ask those questions. After few weeks of waiting, they rejected me with the official letter. When I asked for detailed feedbacks, again, no responses ever from the HR side. I'm not saying I'm the perfect candidate, but the entire experience with Facebook gives me little confident in how their user research could ever respect their users, not to mention understand and put users on their first place. Ignorant and disrespectful as they are, they simply think they are the best and you don't worth their time at all.",Negative Experience,Average Interview,Facebook

They didn't have good experienced folks for the design interviews. I was not impressed by them at all. Some of them didn't talk and interact as much and didn't answer clarifying questions about the design properly. Seemed like they just wanted to sit back and enjoy the candidate going off in a different direction than what they were expecting. Almost felt like they had made up their mind from the beginning and didn't want to bother steering the candidate in the right direction. The design interviews are very subjective and didn't seem like a good and fair assessment to me. They need to provide more interview training and communication skills to their interviewers and also have candidates rate interviewers on their interview experience. The interviewers are not interviewing for their team so they don't have good incentive to approve / reject the right candidates (and hence the results are very biased, which is bad for FB). Also they should respond more quickly after interviews so candidates don't get false hope due to the super long wait.

By the time I could ask him questions, I had to go due to an urgent event that I had scheduled (and he wanted me to stay on the call for another 20 minutes to make up for the lost 20 minutes earlier from his late call).

I met every qualification to the T but rejected and I did not receive any feedback. People who interviewed me I checked their LI and none have any experience related to the job, but they got hired for whatever reason. My questions to the FB HR what diversity you talk about in PR?

 Tell me about your best collaboration experience.   ,No Offer,"I had a video chat with the HR rep, a video portfolio review/interview with another content strategist, I had to do a content strategy exercise, and then I was flown in for interviews and lunch with the team. Before the interviews, I had to give a ""presentation"" about myself, my past work and the content strategy exercise. The exercise was incredibly time-consuming albeit very interesting, and they told me very few people get through it. It's clear that they use it to weed people out who either don't want to work that hard, or more unfortunately/likely, have families, lives, etc. that take precedence over work. The presentation was also pretty nerve-wracking but almost everyone was super nice and understanding and tried to make me feel comfortable. They all had to go through it too and probably realize most people are afraid of public speaking. Each interview had a different theme: collaboration, UX writing and strategy. The UX writing session consisted of an in-interview test. And the lunch was not actually part of the interview process (Really! A friend who works there confirmed this for me; she was never asked for feedback when she took an candidate to lunch.), so it was a chance to ask questions that you wouldn't want to ask in an interview (like what is the work-life balance really like?) A few of the interviewers said some things/asked some questions in the interview that felt mildly inappropriate or at least not very professional. I got a weird feeling that a lot of the people who work at Facebook are quite smart but also pretty socially awkward, and not just the engineers like you'd expect. You also don't interview for a specific position, so it's hard to know whether or not you'll like the people on the team you're going to be on. Overall, however, the process was incredibly tightly organized, and HR was great. They really thoroughly prepare you and communicate everything. They're constantly available throughout the weekend when you're doing your exercise, etc. I also felt like I got a really good feel for the company and what it'd be like to work there during the process.",Neutral Experience,Average Interview,Facebook

Once again, I had no other conversation around the role. The prep email was generic. And my schedule of who I was meeting changed three times. Fast forward to interview. There is not any type of prep of what to do onsite so it felt awkward. Especially since their ""security"" front desk in office was not welcoming and acted as if you should know where to go and what to do. I was walked in by another Recruiter who briefly showed me the new office. Decorated brightly but smaller than I thought. My negotiation interview lacked the proper details and the interviewer lacked enthusiasm. Basically try this negotiation problem based on math but not human behavior. The second interviewer was energetic and felt more of a conversation. The final interview was about sourcing and felt more like probing to give details on how to source and where I pull from. Throughout the whole interview, it felt more like they were trying to get information about where I work and their competition than caring about me as a Recruiter.

With life's busy schedules its difficult to consistently make time for calls and have them reschedule, or be late, or really be unnecessary.

However I got the email from my recruiter after 4 hours saying that I have been selected for Onsite interview. Again I had a 45 minute call with the recruiter and he gave a bunch of study materials. I went through all those and scheduled my onsite interview after a month. As others mentioned it was end to end test cases and it was interesting and challenging. It was mostly SQL and then a little data modeling, visualization and python coding (just 1 pgm). They give a scenario or issue and ask us to brain storm the issue and figure out the root cause which should match their expectation. once it matches they will write a transaction table data (like a log file data) and then ask us to write a bunch of SQL queries. Behavioral interview was around 12 questions. all related to how you handle situations at work. lunch interview was just a chat. be prepared to ask a few questions during that. Overall, I did well. However after 3 days my recruiter called me and told that I was not selected because they expected more perfection in SQL whereas my product knowledge and data modeling was good. Just one thing. Don't panic about 5 hour interview. Time just flies once you are inside your interview room. Also food was good and people were nice. It was a very good experience.

 How do you find people other than linkedin   ,No Offer,"Standard Phone screen x2 with an on site visit. As a recruiter one would expect the recruiters conducting the interview to have a modicum of enthusiasm about bringing a like minded person into the fold. Nooooo, my experience could best be described as calm indifference . Sure they go through the process in the prescribed manner, usual questions and scenario based probes pertaining to measurable experience but to be honest, i felt compelled to write a review. No passion, rather tired and sad people who upon deeper questioning all seemed to feel rather underwhelmed. The best bit was the last interviewer who carefully explained to me that they would decide my fate once they had worked out a bit and ""noodled"" my responses. At no point did they sell to me and at no point did they give me any indication as to why their company was in any way different from any other large profitable mega corp. Oh sure, they were gleeful in pointing out the eternal meals and back rubs available on site. To be honest, as a recruiter your job is to instill a sense of passion about your company and represent it in a reasonable light. At Facebook it was almost assumed that you should be interested in the place and the sell was one way. You selling to them. How sad. I have worked for some of the most successful companies in this business and also for some true horror shows, but my Facebook interview does go down as one of the least inspiring experiences i have had in a long career as a recruiter. Factor out arrogance and inexperience, these people were browbeaten, deflated and unenthusiastic folks. So sad because i hoped that Seattle and its dynamic hotpot of opportunity could have stirred up something more compelling from them. Sounds a bit like sour grapes but that is not the case. I have never seen such a lack of passion from people tasked to engender desire to join a company in my life. Sad but had to let you know that was what i experienced.

If you move forward, you go to onsite interviews. For my experience, FB was very quick to set everything up for me (heard back about not moving to onsite the day after my phone screen). It seems that FB values not only the optimal solution for questions, but being quick on your feet to identify the optimal solution and implementing it quickly. While I ended up getting the optimal solution (question is on Leetcode), I struggled with an edge case for ~15 minutes before the interviewer edged me to rectifying it. However, interviewer was pleasant to talk to. First 5-ish minutes were spent discussing what I was working on at my internship and what my interviewer's team does, 35-ish minutes on the one coding question, then rest of the time spent asking more questions.

,No Offer,"I was initially contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. They set me up with an initial phone screening to ask personality and behavioral questions. This phone screen went really well, and I was quickly asked to schedule a technical interview which would take place over the phone and on Coder Pad. I studied algorithm design and whiteboard coding for about two months to prep for the interview to come. Interview day finally arrived, and I was called by a developer who told me that the interview would be based on my problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and it would be totally fine if I didn't know all of the language syntax because that would be absurd. First, I was asked basic questions about my programming language of choice (Swift). What is an optional? What are some ways we can unwrap optionals? What does the question mark do? What's the difference between a Class and a Struct? When would be an appropriate time to use one vs. the other? I was then asked the fairly popular, medium-level Merge Intervals leetcode question. It took me about ten minutes to walk through my process, code out my algorithm, and run through edge cases. The interviewer said that I had successfully solved the question, and moved on to the second step of the interview. This step required me to debug a faulty TableView. After making quick work of this step (I'm very familiar with TableViews - who isn't?), we moved on to the third and final coding question. I was asked to write a function that would run some task on a background thread asynchronously, and run a second task on the main thread after the async-task was complete. I wasn't exactly sure of the syntax for Grand Central Dispatch, and mentioned this to my interviewer. Regardless, I pushed on. I wrote out what I thought the syntax might be, explaining the difference between threads, the benefits/drawbacks of background vs. main, how GCD works in iOS. When I was done, I had something that, while syntactically incorrect, would run a completion block on the main thread after finishing the async-task. The interviewer kept repeatedly asking, ""You don't know the syntax for this?"" To which I continuously replied, ""No, I usually have a custom function that handles this sort of stuff for me, but I know exactly how it works."" And I would go on explaining exactly how GCD works and why. As you can probably already tell, I did not get the job. I was emailed by the recruiter two days later saying they had chosen to go with someone with a better understanding and memory of the syntax. I was shocked. Blown away. Not only do you constantly hear from recruiters, interview prep, and the Facebook tech community that syntax isn't super important during the process, but to have the interviewer explicitly state that it wouldn't matter, you would think they were telling the truth. Why would a ""good"" programmer memorize the syntax of everything? How is this really that important? When will there ever really be a time when I don't have code-complete during my job? I honestly loved the idea of working at Facebook. I still do, in fact, but working for people who don't realize or care how broken the interview process is, would get annoying real quick.",Negative Experience,Easy Interview,Facebook

While this certainly applies for most companies, they are definitely looking for candidates who are excited about the particular position and team -- not just wanting to work at Facebook because they've heard about all the perks. Also be prepared to have situations and experiences on hand to walk through, such as how you've handled a conflict, what's something you're proud of that you worked on, etc. The recruiters I worked with were great - always on hand to answer any questions, everything in the process moved really quickly.",Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,Facebook

I left the interview expecting a good chance of an offer as I had solved most of the problems except for running out of time in that case.

There were no questions about coding, automation, writing sql queries or config management, they were all on linux basics or networking. They turned me down on the call for the position, and suggested I spend less time automating and more time focusing on stuff far below my skill level. Complete waste of my time, and mildly insulting.

 Give me an example of a test you have conducted. Was it successful?

The onsite interview was easy and the interviewers were generally friendly, albeit some clearly under-prepared. If you have even a basic understanding of media strategy, A/B testing, and general KPI metrics - it should be a breeze. Most challenging part of the process is writing a media proposal (literally writing on a white board, as they do not provide a calculator, pen, or paper to create a basic grid or make calculations), in 10 minutes with partial data. Provided you have any experience planning and thinking on your feet, again this shouldn't present any real challenges - just bring a calculator and a pen/paper if that is your style. After getting a vote of approval from the panel interviewers, I was moved to meeting with a hiring manager who was out on leave at the time, and placed back in a queue to wait. After 5 months of starting and stopping, I decided to withdraw my application.

I was a bit slow in answering the question so I only got through one full question whereas other candidates got through one and rushed through a second.

Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students.

Since I had no idea about that class (and there's really no reason for anyone to know it off top of their heads), I wasted a lot of time trying to solve something that I could have never solved.

My advice : the question may be very different from what you think it probably is, so spend enough time making sure you get it.

 What have you been working on recently?   ,No Offer,"I was contacted via email by HR saying that my friend had recommended I be interviewed for a spot at the company. I was pretty surprised by this, but have found that this is how Facebook often goes about doing things. We scheduled an interview for a few days later, which I thought was going to be a technical interview. When I got on the phone with the interview he asked me about what I've been working on recently, and so I got into this whole thing about my research project which I probably took a good 10 - 15 minutes describing. He basically just verbally nodded through the whole thing. He then asked me about what positions I was interested in interviewing for at Facebook. In my push to prepare for what I was expecting to be a technical interview, I somehow neglected to actually figure out what specifically I could work on at Facebook. I mentioned doing something with the large data sets they work on, since my research focused somewhat loosely on large-scale data analysis. Should have prepped for that one, but no problem. He then told me that he'd be happy to set me up for a phone interview with an engineer as soon as possible and I was like ""whaa?! I thought you were one!"". Not actually, but I did say that I'd be happy to interview with an engineer and so he got that set up for me.

So I patiently rescheduled with HR for the next day. The 2nd interviewer now calls 20 minutes late. Is fairly rude and capricious. Says that he is in a hurry. Did not explain his problem correctly. When I explained my solution, quickly tacked on some additional requirements and then said my solution did not work. The interview only lasted about 15 minutes. Said that he worked on consistency problems at facebook. Everybody knows how horrible the facebook newsfeed consistency is. Total time wasted with these people = 4hours (over two weeks, not including recruiter time). Compensation offered for my time; none.

The recruiter told me about the position and told me that the interviews had been taking place already and they had reached final stages with some candidates. This was disappointing to hear as I liked the sound of the role and was very interested. They said they would schedule for the next interview stage anyway but took them almost 2 more weeks to respond back. They responded saying the position had moved to an offer stage and they were no longer interviewing. This was a waste of my time and if the process was quicker perhaps I would have been able to at least have a chance at the role.

 Your biggest achievement / accomplishment you are proud of   ,No Offer,"It was not my first application at FB so I knew what to expect (more-less) and I usually was able to reach the onsite stage in my past applications, I am also quite experienced in interviewing not only with FB but in general with Dublin's top tech companies. This means I know if and when I did really poorly or made a mistake during the process. In this particular case my interview ended at round 2, business screen (video call) with a team member which was a bit of shocker 2 me. I must admit that I am not a huge fan of team members/peers being involved in the interview process so much because here's too much personal ""liking"" factor involved there - i notice it's become a norm in big tech/social media companies - unfortunately it may either enrich or damage the process and its vulnerability is usually hard to spot (bad decision makers/interviewers). This time I was preparing for this interview a lot, as I didn't want to lose to stronger candidate like previously I did. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to showcase myself and my experience properly as it relates to Escalations and XFN collaboration experience. The questions that were asked by my interviewer were somehow either too general or too specific in a strange way that it didn't give me any room to put my rich experience in a context of this specific role. Instead of asking me something more specific from my experience I was asked about my biggest achievement/I am most proud of... first of all it's hard to answer such a question straight away having dealt with so many though cases, it also very subjective. The answer may be cool for me but it may not sound cool to the interviewer. Then problematic team relationships....I really disliked the questions because I felt they were exploring me in a wrong way and in a result, my answers gave a false impression of me as a candidate. I am not a sore loser... but I know when I was dismissed too early/unfairly. It wasn't my best interview that's for sure but it wasn't bad either. My colleague who is an interviewer at FB shared with my in confidence that I was assessed by that guy as ""strong no hire"". I had interviewed with FB more than once before and always reached onsite stage for roles where I was less match to compared to this one. I interviewed with Linkedin, Airbnb, Google etc and I reached onsites there as well. I usually never fall off once I pass HR screening call before the last stage at any company. Because I prepare and I am not stupid. In this case unfortunately the interviewer didn't help me to present and explore my relevant experience, although he was polite I didn't feel he liked me. Maybe he wanted to eliminate me to give his ""mate"" a bigger chance during onsites (there were not many candidates in the mix) or maybe he didn't want to have another LGBT competition on his team. Whatever the reason was, maybe it's better he rejected me sooner than later (he usually participates in onsite stages). In my opinion FB should be more cautions whom it entrusts the hiring decisions, especially in a stage when one person decides about somebody's future. I am always anxious when such decision is not made by a professional hiring manager, instead - just an interview-trained senior team member. It may be very risky to the company and painful for such candidates like me who work very very hard to make their dreams come true.",Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,Facebook

Was really deflated by this approach and during my decline call he mentioned he couldn't go into detail about my feedback. Overall quite disappointing and happy to accept I wasn't the strongest candidate, but I feel a human/personable approach wouldn't have hurt.",Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,Facebook

,No Offer,"The process took approximately 3 months. This was overwhelmingly positive despite not receiving an offer and I say this as someone who has been both a hiring manager and candidate, having been through processes that were a lot less desirable. The recruiter based in Dublin (IE) assigned was nothing short of excellent. The first stage was a pre-call post a referral and a short telephone interview - this was mostly competency and interest based. This followed up with a BlueJeans (video) call with the hiring manager. This was a mixture of competency and technical based, specifically on examples digging deeper on areas within the job specification. The recruiter kept me informed through the process and then an on-site interview was arranged. This was 3x on-site interviews and one virtually the next day. The recruiter was able to give me solid advice on what topics to expect, and coaching with examples and best practice on each stage for 30 minutes before hand. This was unexpected, but very helpful. The 3x interviews on-site all required using a whiteboard, and to explain case-based scenario questions. The team were very friendly who I had met and put me at ease but I would lie if this wasn't tough - you had to think on the spot and showcase direction of your thoughts. The video interview later in the day was more competency based. Eventually, the team decided not to proceed because of a fit to the role specifically, but I did manage to get good feedback from the recruiter on where to improve. Overall, I felt very positive about the experience at Facebook and the culture experienced during the interview process compared to other companies. The one other element to note is they have a Facebook Ambassadors programme and I had spoken to someone in the team - again, a really encouraging part of the process which gave a good insight to the team and showcased the culture. I'd highly recommend to reach out and take advantage of that.",Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,Facebook

Straight away I felt uneasy however when she started reading questions from a sheet I felt we were finally getting to what I was there for however I felt she was so inexperienced and some responses to the questions she asked she couldn't understand? All through the interview she kept looking at the door at her colleagues going by and would wave and speak to them through the glass which I found so rude but at the end of the interview when she asked if I had any questions really took the biscuit as I asked a simple question about her current role and what she enjoys about it and she basically ran the place and people into the ground!! Not very professional at all!! I kind of got the feeling she didn't like how prepared and knowledgeable I was about the role!! After this interview even though I know I answered everything to how they would (or so I taught) wanted I got a feeling it would be her that wouldn't want toaccept me!! I feel they also just wanted to know what I bring to my current role as I'm well experienced in this area and they wanted to pass it off as their own contributes!!

I have been pitched in at the wrong levels, had my jobs changed out by recruiters with different roles to fill. I have been sent emails to discontinue the process when phone calls had been promised, no replies to quick little questions, left for weeks to chase decisions, misbriefed before interviews. Facebookers are told to ‘prioritise ruthlessly’ however it is used as an excuse for some pretty arrogant, rude and unprofessional behaviour.

 How would you explain technical things to the client who has no tech background.   ,No Offer,"I applied for a different role in different location but a week later the recruiter suggested me to apply for a role in my current city then I accepted and the same day I got a call from her. She replied at night. 1st round was a 25min online coding assessment, I spent 10 min and submitted. A few hours after I got an email from the recruiter and she arranged next round interview. Then I had a coderpad interview with solution engineer manager. The feedback was very positive. The next day I got invited to onsite interview. I finished my coding assignment and met another solution engineer manager, solution engineer and a sales director. The questions were also super easy. One week after I was asked to do another coding interview with a software engineer in HQ as the last round then I failed. I did resolve the problem but I guess it was because my solution was not efficient enough. All the interview questions are very basic and easy to work out. But they do care about the time complexity. When being asked to have additional round of interview after onsite, I did know they still felt not confident about my technical skills. I had 1-2 weeks for preparation between every two interviews. But I didn't really prepare for that long. Even though, I still think I have over prepared. Questions are far easier than my expectation. I just have not noticed these code efficiency issues. Again, that is the key. So that is my coding behavior problem. I get used to get work done fast and didn't use the most optimal way at the beginning. Overal, the communication with them is suprisingly efficient. I have not expected the company at this scale can move so fast. And it is quite straight forward, direct rejection is totally fine to me. At least I do not need to imagine and wait. This is a good chance but unfortunately I miss this chance. It is a good company but I am afraid I won't consider applying any more in the future.

 A modification of the lowest common ancestor problem (bonus points if you answer using RMQs)   ,No Offer,"I applied online and was approached by the HR to initiate the interview process. My next interview was a technical one and I had hoped to clear it, but failed. The interviewer was helpful, but failed to see my perspective. I initially approached to solve the problem in O(N) time using an algorithm that I thought I knew. But I got confused and 15 mins in the interview, I asked whether I could use another approach. This is when I got shaky. I proposed a solution in O(N^2) time. He asked to make it faster and using Hash Tables, I improved the time to O(N) and space to O(N). And with a hint from the interviewer, I ended up solving in O(N) time with constant space (and then started writing the code). During the whole interview session, I accidentally kept confusing things (for instance calling a node,a root node because I was thinking in terms of sub-trees and recursively). This generally doesn't happen even when working under stress. I felt the interviewer grossly underestimated me, but I blame myself for that. If there is anything I would different then it would be to use the easiest approach to solution the question first. A positive start boosts up the confidence. Make sure to explain CLEARLY (using the correct terminology) how to tackle the problem. One more thing: embrace the fact that there is always a possibility of getting rejected. So, blurt out whatever you solution you think should work. There is not enough time to derive your approach. And be confident. Sometimes you can trick the interviewer into believing that you know exactly what to do, even when you don't (if you are close enough).",Neutral Experience,Average Interview,Facebook

,No Offer,I was contacted by an internal HR recruiter based on a previous contact with Facebook HR via linkedin.

The technical interview consisted of some more detail about the job and two scripting tests in a shared collaborative environment and one obscure problem to solve. The first script was to check some number of hosts for a daemon and send email about the hosts that did not have the daemon running. The second was to take a very large list of hosts and see if any were missing by comparing it to a reference list. This really only requires a diff and the interviewer seemed baffled by that solution so he changed the problem to require generating the reference file also. The third question was about accessing files in a directory used as an NFS mount point that had an active mount on top of it. The interviewer explained that the position was an interface between development and operations to avoid difficult deployments due to assumptions one group makes about the others intentions so it would require experience with both development and operations.,Negative Experience,Average Interview,Facebook
