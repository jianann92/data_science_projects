,No Offer,0,Average Interview,"My interviewer showed up on time on the video call, and we started with a problem on a coding site I had never used before. It was pretty clunky. He was interviewing me from China, night for me over in California. I confirmed with him that I understood the problem, but there were lots of gotchas with the half-assembled coding environment that made debugging hard. A lot of time was spent talking out my solution, and we're getting toward the end of the interview, and he reveals to me that I'm solving the wrong problem. At first I hadn't even seen the problem description, and when I did, I just glanced at it really quick, and confirmed with him that I understood it. 40 minutes into the interview, I realize that I was doing the wrong problem. Every time I asked him if I understood it correctly, he said ""yes"". I quickly threw something together that looked good to me and him, but not the right answer. After being on the call for over an hour I called it. Apparently he's an Android developer who doesn't know Kotlin at all, so my code was foreign to him. No Android questions, nothing to do with my day-to-day as an Android developer, no Kotlin, just an algorithms question that wasn't even communicated. If I had slowed down, ignored everything he said, and just read and reread the prompt, I'd be in better shape. He was a really nice interviewer; I felt like he was in my corner. But he does not have enough English experience to truly answer any question in an interview. Because of this, I kept trying to understand him, and he would try to answer again, but I never really understood what he was saying. From the other Glassdoor interview reviews here, I had heard it was a bad experience. And it was bad, but I knew they didn't have it together going in to it, so it wasn't a letdown when it was a disaster. I was expecting it, but still wanted to put my best foot forward, as everyone's experience is unique. The experience was a valuable one, and it showed me how little TikTok cares.",Tiktok,2002,showed time video call started problem coding site never used pretty clunky interviewing china night california confirmed understood problem lot gotchas half assembled coding environment made debugging hard lot time spent talking solution getting toward end reveals solving wrong problem first even seen problem description glanced really quick confirmed understood minute realize wrong problem every time asked understood correctly said yes quickly threw something together looked good not right answer call hour called apparently android developer know kotlin code foreign android nothing day day android developer kotlin algorithm even communicated slowed ignored everything said read reread prompt better shape really nice felt like corner not enough english experience truly answer kept trying understand would try answer never really understood saying glassdoor review heard bad experience bad knew together going letdown disaster expecting still wanted put best foot forward everyone experience unique experience valuable showed little tiktok care

The interviewer was based in Taiwan and the second she joined the call, I could tell it was going to be a terrible chat. She was very unenthusiastic and did not give me a better understanding of the role. She sounded like she was sleepy or occupied with something else. She asked me to tell her about my experience and I did, which I have to say, I honestly think I'm beyond qualified for the position I applied for. She asked if I had any questions for her and I was super confused because she hadn't told me anything about the company other than it's a start up company.

"Basically no questions were asked. I had to mine to get anything out of the interviewer who either didn't like her job, or me.

She asked me to ask her questions, which I did but she answered vaguely, the same apathy she had throughout the interview. The whole thing lasted no more than 10 minutes.

They are insistent on rescheduling the 30-minute interview for the same day later in the evening. Internal interviewer calls me, and the call lasts maybe 10 minutes. Didn't even bother to apologize for the inconvenience. Then goes on to ask the most generic questions that the external recruiters already asked. You could tell this internal recruiter just did not care about talking to me one bit. Waited a week and heard nothing back so I contacted the external recruiters about the status of my candidacy. Originally, they were super responsive (within minutes sometimes), and this time I heard nothing. That was over 2 weeks ago.

" The usual.

However... that was where the good part of the whole process ended. I was told the interview would be done in 2 parts - the first a “peer review” which was conducted by someone in the same role, an informal chat to see if I was a good culture fit, and then a second which would be with hiring manager and cover experience and knowledge and go in to more detail. I had the first part, which was fine, we had a good conversation and got on well. After it ended I waited 15 mins for the hiring manager to join call, but they never did. Ended up speaking to HR (not the recruiter) who explained they were running late and couldn’t make it, so would rearrange. A bit annoying after I’d prepped but these things happen. Several days passed with no response, despite a chase. Ended up getting a call from recruiter to say they weren’t taking me to next stage, and the feedback was I wasn’t concise enough. Excuse me? How is that fair, or proper feedback, when I did my bit and was all prepped to be concise when it came to second part covering experience given that the initial chat was meant to be a friendly conversation. Ive over decade of experience so I certainly know what I am doing and I feel it is unfair, rude and unprofessional to dismiss me when they don’t even really know me or my experience as they literally could not be bothered to do the interview properly. Probably one of the worst interviews I’ve ever had! Either recruiter didn’t coach me well enough (but I think they did) or TikTok are too rushed when doing interviews as they know they’ll have a lot of applicants.

 Tell me about a time you made a mistake   ,No Offer,0,Average Interview,"I have never gone through such a chaotic interview process. I was never told who I would be interviewing with (which is semi-normal), every interviewer asked me the same script of questions, most of them were late, and I waited over 2 months to hear a response if I was chosen for the role while messaging my recruiter weekly with no response.

" What interests you in TikTok, other than the name?   ",No Offer,0,Average Interview,"I interviewed for the ‘Media Manager’ position and had a first round screening call with The talent acquisition which went well and went over my experience and interest in the role/company. This role was a brand new role part of a new team at TikTok so there were ‘unknown’ elements of the job as the company is growing very rapidly. And building out new teams. My second round interview was an in-person interview with the hiring manager which went over the role and responsibilities in more depth, although the interviewer was very new to TikTok and had only just started work there a week prior so this felt very conversational and relaxed. I was told by the talent acquisition team I had passed this round and the third round interview was with a cross-functional team member in a different office, and a video call was arranged to accommodate this. The interview focused more on general skills and competencies which I felt went positive. I followed up numerous times with the talent acquisition team for feedback and was disappointed to receive an automated rejection email for the position 2 weeks after my third round interview. I at least would have appreciated a call or email highlighting some level of detailed feedback as to why I was unsuitable for the position. Personally, I think it is very unprofessional of TikTok not to provide appropriate feedback, especially as I had been in attendance of 3 interviews and was very invested in this process (even attending an in person interview at their offices in Holborn). Judging from their LinkedIn job advertisements I understand they are in the process of growing very rapidly and probably churning through interviews and candidates. However, this lack of communication has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I would reconsider applying for any future roles that appealed to me. Candidate constructive feedback should be a bare minimum requirement, even more so if you have invited a candidate no less then 3 occasions to interview for a role in your company.",Tiktok,2021,interviewed medium manager position first screening call talent acquisition went well went experience interest role company role brand new role part new team tiktok unknown element job company growing rapidly building new team second person hiring manager went role responsibility depth although new tiktok started work week prior felt conversational relaxed told talent acquisition team passed third cross functional team member different office video call arranged accommodate focused general skill competency felt went positive followed numerous time talent acquisition team feedback disappointed receive automated rejection email position week third least would appreciated call email highlighting level detailed feedback unsuitable position personally think unprofessional tiktok not provide appropriate feedback especially attendance invested even attending person office holborn judging linkedin job advertisement understand growing rapidly probably churning candidate however lack communication left bad taste mouth would reconsider applying future role appealed candidate constructive feedback bare minimum requirement even invited candidate le occasion role company
