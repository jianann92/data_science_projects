"Worked very closely with the recruiter over a couple of months to work out a time to visit Seattle for an interview. The recruiter was very capable and showed great passion for finding me a good fit in Amazon. On interview day I met with 5 team members (plus a couple of people just sitting in on the interview) for a total of 45 minutes each. They each spent from 10-20 minutes discussing prior experiences and then gave me a somewhat open-ended coding problem to solve on the whiteboard. Most of them mentioned that the result wasn't important, but was more interested in how I came to the conclusions that I did. During the whiteboarding I got very little feedback on how I was doing (one interviewer was typing vigorously on his laptop the entire time & was either taking a lot of notes or doing work himself). It was very hard to tell if I was going off on a tangent that they weren't interested in or if I was on track. At the end of the day I was happy with all of my solutions & didn't feel like I'd gotten stumped on any of the topics. There was one interview, though, that looking back on I wish I'd done differently. The recruiter mentioned that I could use any programing language that I wanted, but I would suggest to everyone to consider using something that the interviewer is familiar with. In the one questionable interview I used C# along with IEnumerables & LINQ to solve the problem. The interviewer asked a lot of questions on what IEnumerables were & probably thought I'd made up LINQ. At the end of the interview I doubt he had any idea what I had done. In hindsight, I should've used more basic C# or used another language entirely so the interviewer could understand what I was doing.", Write a function to calculate build order given a project with a list of dependencies that also need to be built   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,Amazon

"I was hired on through SMX Staffing. I began by simply filling out an online application then got a call about a week later inviting me into the interview.. During the interview The notable parts are one you have to have both ID and original Social security card or birth certificate otherwise you will be turned away.

I met recruiters at a college supply chain career fair. I stopped by because the recruiters were all dressed in jeans and t-shirts instead of suits like all the other companies. I really liked how lax they were. I chatted with them and they asked me to apply. I interviewed with them the very next day on campus and it went great. The interview questions and math problems listed in here were word for word the same things they asked me. The interviewer was VERY friendly and it was more like talking with a buddy than someone interviewing me. This was on Tuesday Sept 16th (I'm writing this on Friday after the interview) and they told me that because they had done so many interviews that I wouldn't hear anything until Friday at the very earliest but I ended up getting an email from them the very next day saying that they were really impressed and that they wanted me to come back for a final interview on Oct 4th. I'm very excited to see how this next interview goes and to see what they offer. One thing they suggested that I read up in before the final interview was Amazon's Customer Obsession. I put that I wasn't given an offer but we'll see after my final interview.

"Applied online at amazonfulfillmentcareers.com for the new fulfillment center that just opened up in Moreno Valley, CA. Received a few emails over the following 3 weeks pertaining to the hiring process, videos and information about what it's like to work at an Amazon Fulfillment Center and when the company would begin hiring. Finally received an email inviting me to set up an interview appointment date which all dates available wouldn't be for another 3 weeks. So I picked the closest date possible and received a confirmation email a few minutes later with information on a Direct Hire Event they were having at the Hyatt Hotel in Downtown Riverside and what I should bring to the event (government issued I.D. and proof of education). Went to the hotel, followed the amazon signs which led me to about 4 tables with Amazon employees where I checked in, gave them my I.D. and P.O.E and was handed a congratulatory offer of employment, which was contingent upon successfully passing the drug test and background check, of course. They were some other people there who also received an offer of employment and the took us to a room where they discussed information on where we would be working, benefits, pay and we completed our drug test. Was told that we should receive the results of our drug test and background checks by email between 7-14 days. Did all of this within the span of an hour and we were all out the door.

"I was recruited by an Amazon recruiter who found my resume online. Thought I was a little skeptical (I didn't have some of the requirements like an MBA), the recruiter said I could interview with a potential team member in the next few days, so I thought, ""why not?"" They sent me a 6-page writing test and asked me to fill it out prior. The phone interview lived up to Amazon's reputation. The interviewer didn't ask me anything about myself or describe the job. It was a 50 minutes barrage of intense interview questions, poking holes into answers trying to weed out weakness. When I would give broad examples, they would interrupt to ask specifics, which was hard to do because my current job is very entrenched in internal process. At the beginning, the interviewer explained that they would ask me a question, then mute the phone while I answered and they typed. This might've been a tactic--without any back-and-forth, I certainly rambled on more than normal. The interviewer was considerate and left 10 minutes for my questions, though I hardly knew where to start as they had given almost no insight into the position.

"My resume was submitted through an employee referral and I was invited for an on-site interview at the Amazon Campus in Seattle for a group interview. There was no previous phone screening in my case. We were randomly distributed into 3-person teams and everyone was presented with 3 different problems. The Amazon interviewers and current developers present there mentioned that the problems were simplified versions of real issues that Amazon was dealing with. In our team we had to come to an agreement as to which interviewee would take on which problem. After that, you were pretty much on your own to solve the problem. Each interviewee was given a laptop and there were a variety of programming languages and IDEs available and even an Ubuntu VM. I chose Java, NetBeans, and Windows. You should really choose what you are most comfortable with; don't try to improvise there. Unlike white boards interviews, here you had to get an actual program working, pseudo code would not cut it. On the other hand, you had plenty of time to think about your solution, which is not really the case in other 1 on 1 interviews. Common online resources were available (Google, StackOverflow), you just were not allowed to access personal repositories (Dropbox, etc). Every two hours you would stop coding and would explain your thought process to an interviewer for about 30 minutes, analyzing your approach, your reasoning and what you could do to improve your solution.

I was originally contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. After responding I was able to set up an appointment. Amazon was conducting a series of interviews in NYC which lasted about half a day. There were 5 interviewers (including HR) and the interview process and questions were almost identical to those defined in Cracking the Coding Interview. This was my first interview in 7 years and I have to say they did a great job of making me feel comfortable during the process. My previous experiences weren't all that great.,Most of the questions weren't all that difficult and there was very little pressure in solving them. The point was really to see the process of arriving at your answer.

"Applied online for seasonal work from home associate. Took approx. 3-4 weeks before I heard anything. Got an email out of the blue asking me to take a test online. It took 45-60 minutes. There is a test regarding knowledge of computers, fairly basic but I was caught off guard and not expecting that. Personality test with 75 questions which contain the kind of questions you sometimes are not sure how to answer. For example, do you like art? or flowers? off the wall stuff like that. The fun part was doing a simulation of actual calls. They give you a quick lesson on how to use a mock system and then you have to answer customer calls and know how to navigate all of the screens. Pay close attention to the instructions. I did really well on that and it was fun. At the end I got a response that I did well and was ready to go to the next step of the hiring process which is the phone interview. Do not be lax about the interview. Just because it is on the phone does not mean it is easy or not important. The interviewer questioned me on computer knowledge - ""Name 3 web browsers"", ""How do you close Outlook if it freezes"". Then he asked several questions about handling bad customers. I thought it went well but I have not heard back and it has been 2 weeks. I applied for part time and when he called to interview me he told me that all of the part time positions were taken and he only had full time. I told him I couldn't work full time. He wanted to proceed with the interview in case something ""opens up"". I'm not sure if I didn't get a call back because of that or because they didn't want me. I think it's rude not to let someone know one way or the other. If I take the time to interview and go through all of this testing the least you can do is drop an email and say one way or the other.

"Applied online. Received an e-mail a couple of weeks later saying they were interested in me after seeing my resume and wanted 3 specific times I would be available for a phone interview with an Operations Manager. A few days after I replied I received an e-mail stating the time I would be receiving a call and to confirm. I received the call right on time and the interview lasted around 30-40 minutes but I had lots of questions after the actual interview was complete. Standard situational questions. Interview went well needless to say and a few more days later I received an e-mail stating I had been selected for an in person interview. The e-mail contained some instructions for what to do and not to do at the facility and what not to bring with you. Do not bring your cell phone with you to even check in at the front desk, it will count against you if you do. Also attached to the e-mail were some case study questions to be answered and sent back to the recruiter. Again, confirmation was requested in the e-mail, be sure to do so ASAP. The recruiters are very friendly and are there to help you with any questions you might have. But, honestly, they don't have a lot of knowledge on what happens at the facility. The in person interview lasts 5 hours and you will be interviewed by five people and have a 30 min tour of the facility you are interviewing at, Some people might actually come in from out of state and your travel expenses will be comped. I live 30 min away from the facility so I had no real expenses for travel. It was an extensive interview process to say the least. Most interviews I've been in or given last 45 minutes to maybe 1.5 hours. Don't be fooled by the whole ""we are in innovative company and want innovative people"" slogan. Its not true, they want people who follow the established process, keep their heads down and do their job. After you have been there for a year or more, THEN you can say something about the process. See, I came from in industry that is always improving, so I have a trained eye for where things can improve. I made the mistake of mentioning a couple of ways they could improve just by what I saw during the tour and they didn't like that very much. If you want the job, love what you see. During the interviews make sure you stick to the point, don't get caught up in your story, keep your answers detailed but as short as possible and use the STAR format. They love that. The Math question is given to you before the interviews and you have 15 minutes to ""solve"" the problem. There is an answer, don't be afraid to get into decimals like .5 or .75 if you can. You are given a calculator and its not that hard, not easy but certainly not hard either. I signed a non disclosure so I can't specify the rate problem but I will tell you that it is available on this site, at least the problem I received. One of the interviewers will go over the math problem with you and after you explain your thoughts and how you came to your conclusion they will throw a curve ball at you. Again, its not hard or easy but if you think aloud and consider all the implications you will do well. They are looking for professional people not excited, promoter style friendly people. They want serious, not stuffy but on point people who will get the job done. Keep a straight face, don't make jokes, be positive but not excited and you'll get the offer. I misunderstood my audience, thinking they were looking for creative people who are innovators and passionate about their job. They may want passion but not the ""marketing"" kind of creativity and passion. They aren't about sales per say at the distribution centers, at least that's the feeling I got, its not their job to sell but to perform. I'm all about sales, w/o sales there is no reason to have a DC... To them, its the web designers job to sell and theirs to get the product to the customer. I definitely agree with getting the job done efficiently and they do a great job, I think they would do much better if they had some sales minded people in their DC, but its their company vision not mine. I did get an offer, but after the experience I had, with the answers I got to my questions I decided to look elsewhere. If you take the job be prepared to work lots of hours for not lots of pay. Its not until you get to the Senior Operations Manager level that the real fun begins and you can think of ways to improve the company and process. Till then, shut up and do your JOB! Seriously, this is of course my opinion on what I saw and heard, it may be different after all. The interview took place on a Thursday afternoon and I received the offer request by e-mail on Monday but never had the offer conversation."," Be careful how you reply to why you are looking for another job, why you are not happy with your current or previous position.

"I was contacted by an Amazon recruiter via email to set up a phone interview. The email indicated that I would be interviewed by a ""hiring team"". I received a call from one person, who would be the hiring manager.

I was then contacted a few days later that I would need to have another phone interview with another person on the hiring ""team"". This is where things got bizarre.

What can you do for me (in this department)? What should I know? 11. Biggest difficulty you've had to overcome in career.

The full-day interview was mostly pleasant, but it was very clear that certain questions asked (especially as the day grew longer) were mainly done in an effort to trip you up or to make you uncomfortable.

"The recruiting process started off with two separate phone interviews which involved basic questions about my experiences in finance and interest in Amazon. I made it to the on-site interviews easily, where I interviewed with seven Amazon employees in 1:1 interviews. At the on-site interviews, I was shocked at the behavior of a few of my interviewers. I signed an NDA, but I was frequently asked proprietary questions regarding my past employers, which had nothing to do with my skills or abilities. I could not answer these questions. Also, one of my last interviewers asked detailed questions about an experience from two years ago in what seemed like an attempt to bully me into saying I don't know something or answering incorrectly. The interviewer was visibly disgusted and annoyed when I asked questions to clarify the case question which came after six hours of interviewing. I never had an interviewer make me feel like trash before. I left the company questioning why they brought me in for interviews if they were going to ask irrelevant questions and were skeptical about my capabilities.

"Submitted resume via university jobs board in July. In mid August, got an email from a recruiter inviting me to a group interview 10 days later. Amazon provided all travel and expenses, including 2 nights in a hotel, $85/day in transportation and $65/day in food. Interview began at 8:15 am, with 24 candidates. Vast majority of candidates presented non-American passports as identification, and only 2 were female. Breakfast was provided, two current SDEs talked to the group and took questions, then we were divided into groups of 3 and presented with a supply chain problem to solve on laptops with clean Ubuntu installs. No guidance or preference for programming languages or problem solving techniques were expressed; instead, they expect your group to come to a consensus, install the necessary tools, and rock it out. It was stressed repeatedly the exercise was NOT competitive, but instead team oriented. A group was put in each corner of the room, and a table of SDEs and HR reps sat in the middle of the room and ""observed"" 6 hours of work. After several hours, each candidate got a 15-20 minute 1-on-1 with an SDE to discuss the code they'd written (and not much else). The entire process is geared to maximize success for 21-25 year old males and eliminate anyone female and/or older, and inherently makes forming a quick team difficult. It's also obvious Amazon expects that new employees are looking for stepping stones rather than a long-term career as they make no effort to get to know any of the candidates, or identify specific teams on which they may fit. Got a call 2 days after getting home letting me know they wouldn't be making an offer, which was wonderful news as I was completely clear that based on the interview process, Amazon would not be a good fit for me and would have declined an offer anyway.", How would you distribute inventory to minimize the number of missed delivery dates while keeping costs to Amazon low?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,Amazon

"This interview was obtained through a recruiter and the position was based in Seattle. Amazon did not have any suitable candidates in the pipeline and after the recruiter submitted my resume along with 1/2 a dozen others, only mine was chosen for an interview. Later, another candidate was ""brought back from the no pile"", to ensure a competitive process which Amazon prefers. The first 1 hr phone interview was with a peer, as all Amazon employees are asked to interview candidates for similar positions from time to time. A week later, the second 1 hr phone interview took place with the hiring manager. Typically, after passing these stages, successful candidates would be invited to Seattle to meet in person. However, this specific posting required a unique skill set, for which Amazon only had one subject matter expert currently employed. Therefore, another 1 hr phone interview took place with the subject matter expert. After passing this, I was certain an invitation to the office would follow, but both myself and the other candidate were asked to submit a written piece on the specialized subject matter. Making sure that external experts had reviewed my work prior and after submitting, it took me 3 days to put together a very professional document. This stage took another week to process and revert, resulting in the other candidate not being selected to continue.

I estimate that about 200 candidates went through the process, spread out over three days. The Talent Acquisition personnel were very helpful and gave out lots of pointers on how to do well in the interviews. They were very clear that we were not competing against each other for one job. They have hundreds of openings and they are looking for solid leadership skills that make for a good fit within their corporate culture. Each interviewer had a competency to focus on. Figure out what that is (it will be obvious, in fact he or she will probably tell you what it is) and then bend all your answers to that topic. They tell you several times during the process to bring up numbers and quantified success. My advice: even if the question has nothing to do with numbers, like a leadership or motivational ability question, put numbers in your answer anyway, and do it at the start of the question. (""When I was with XYZ Corp., a 2.3 billion dollar company, in charge of n employees, I showed leadership by..."") The math flow and case studies are more conversational in nature. And when they say 'show your work' they mean they want to see the actual full-out equation that gets the numbers you talk about.

I applied for the job through a friend and current Amazon employee. After 5 weeks HR finally contacted me to schedule a phone interview. The interview was scheduled with a DMM that was in a completely different area than what I applied for. The interviewer jumped right into questions without any introduction of herself or what she does at Amazon. The interview itself consisted of pretty basic questions overall related to the position. My issue was the major language barrier between me and the interviewer. Most of the questions were situational so I used the STAR approach to respond to her questions. After literally every question she said she didn't understand and asked for clarification on various terms or tactics that I was discussing. It really threw the whole interview off balance. She ended her questions after about 40 mins and asked if I had any questions for her. I got one question in before she ended the interview.

"Amazon posted an intern offer on my school career website. I submitted my resume, was contact about 2 weeks later to schedule two 45 minute phone interview. First interview I was asked about to describe projects on my resume, then was asked to list off some data structures. Asked to list all the sorting algorithms I could think of (only listed mergesort, quicksort) and then was asked if I knew the runtimes of these. Then was a coding question which I can't remember, something to do with strings. I had to read it aloud back to him. Asked how I could improve it and the runtime. Then asked about object oriented programming and how I would represent a card game and which methods it would need. The interview ended with me asking questions. The second interview was with someone with a heavier Indian accent, he said he was a tester. He asked me the difference between an arraylist and linked list, then to write a program on paper, I cant remember what it was exactly. I was then asked how I would test the program and if there were bugs how I would deal with them. Then asked about polymorphism and inheritance. Interview ended with me asking questions. I was contacted about a week later to schedule a 3rd phone interview and they actually apologized that I had to have one. Had the interview a week later and right off the bat was asked only one programming question. It was how to find a subset in a string. I had to describe the runtime. The interview was only a half hour I believe and it ended with me just talking to the guy, he had been working there for 7 years and knew someone else who had for 13 years. Asked about the pagers, etc. The day after I was offered an acceptance. To tell the truth, I thought I ruined my chance with all interviews. I answered runtimes wrong, and admitted I didn't remember what polymorphism was. So I was very surprised that I had an offer for another interview. I also thought I ruined the 3rd interview because it took em a very long time to figure the answer--and I don't even know if i got the right answer in the end, because the interviewer had to help me.

I was even asked to write java snippet for a frequency calculation problem. I was then told that this interview was being conducted for a software for the development team responsible for the development of the application for the inventory data management. This application is later used by the spend analysts and machine learning experts to perform analysis tasks. I was very disappointed by this process. I mean how can they even shortlist me for the software development role when even the jd mentioned AI work., Write a java program to calculate the frequency of the online series data.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,Amazon

"My experience mimicked the first post. Despite numerous inquiries via phone prior 1st interview regarding documentation, I was advised to bring only specific documents and leave others. Only needed 2 of the 5 items requested. Was successful during the first interview and offered a 2nd with an actual Amazon recruiter. Dressed appropriately in shirt, tie, slacks... The interviewer read me the same questions as the staffing agency rep (saw the form). Was energetic and thought I had aced the interview. Was told would be taken to the next station. After waiting again to sit down was introduced to the ""Integrity"" staffer who mumbled something about Amazon not deciding to ""move to the next step"". But, was offered an appointment in the Phoenix office the next week to take the assessment and review my documentation. When I balked stating I had already completed the process and did not understand the goal of the appointment, his co-worker piped in to say Amazon opted not to provide me a full time position at that time. However, the staffing agency is still providing temporary employees to Amazon and I would be seeking one of those positions. Unemployed and not wanting burn any bridges, I accepted the appointment (still in the future). Like the first poster, I traveled 60 miles round trip twice only to be left hanging. Being a former warehouse manager with years of experience and a myriad of job experiences, I cannot see how I was not fully qualified for an entry position. Perhaps Amazon is hiring a select few.

"I applied through the website I actually read in the newspaper. 2 days later, I received a call about setting up an interview. I called the number back that I was given and realized that it was a hot line. There were only 2 options: where to leave questions for the Amazon recruiter and where to talk to a rep from the staffing agency if you needed to apply in their office if you didn't have a computer. It was confusing for me but I knew their website had a chat function so I logged on there and talked with a rep who told me to just call the number and somebody would eventually pick up. So I called back and waited...and waited....and waited 15 minutes before realizing that no one was picking up so I pressed option 2, after the previous time I called and pressed option 1 and no one called me back when I left a message. I got a hold of a person who told me where the interview would be, in a city of course 30 miles away. I didn't get the option at that time to choose what time I wanted to come in, wasn't even aware that you could. I didn't end up going the first time because I just wasn't sure if this was a job I wanted to take, something where I wanted to be driving over a hundred miles both ways. I didn't take the second interview time I set up either but did figure 3rd time's the charm. I showed up and felt like a complete moron. After talking to the staffing rep the 2nd time, she told me to show up in jeans, sneakers, and a comfortable t-shirt, so that's exactly what I did. Everyone else: In business suits. Thanks Integrity Staffing on that one! I was a little freaked because I thought the guy said that only official transcripts were being accepted and all I brought was my unofficial one, luckily it had my graduation date on it so they accepted it. Then you sit in 3 rows of about 15 or so chairs. 5 people get to sit on the computer taking the skills test while you wait for your turn. It was, overall, child's play. It was the most ridiculously easy test and I finished with a 20/20 in under 4 minutes. I watched an older gentlemen sitting there reading the instructions for about 10-15 minutes before beginning and I was starting to feel sorry for him before I got my turn. I also watched an African American male take his time on his and then the computer went back to the first screen. He raised his hand and told the pre-screening guys that his computer shut off in the middle of the test. They checked and he actually ran out of time so they had to disqualify him. Then after the skills test, you went and sat on the other side of the room and read these gold and blue sheets on the full job description and Integrity Staffing's policies, which left me confused because when I talked with the lady for my first interview, she said it was a direct hire position, so why do I have to worry about Integrity's drug testing policy? Then once you're done reading that (and hitting them up for free soda and candy), they pull you into another room which is bound to throw you off because they have people just separated with not even walls, just dividers and you can hear everybody's answers to the interviewer's questions. I actually sat longer in the first room, watching this one interviewer just gossiping with the lady at the desk next to hers and making eye contact with her awkwardly, while people who finished the test after me got pulled in to do theirs, even though I had finished reading my paperwork. It turned out that Miss Gossip was actually my interviewer. Awesome! :( She pulled me in, sat me down, and then immediately ran back over to gossip with her desk mate real quick. Not a great first impression. Then she comes over, starts asking me the 10-15 questions she's supposed to 'grade' me on, and which I can hear other people answering and just tailoring my answers to what they say. She asked me this question that I didn't really understand and I can't remember exactly what it was but it was along the lines of, ""How have you dealt with directions from management?"" It sounded almost like an unfinished question the way she asked it and when I tried to get her to clarify, she wouldn't really so I just had to BS my way through that question. She had me sitting there awkwardly for 5 minutes while she 'graded' my answers and then handed me a piece of paper for another interview August 4th. She also told me that I should show up in business casual that time while I struggled not to tell her that it was her stupid staffing agency that told me it was OK to wear what I was wearing in the first place. She also handed me an application to fill out and sent me to the back of the room, where they had a table, chairs, and pens to do so.

After they were satisfied with the explanation, they threw some curve balls to show I could think on my feet. I was then asked to go into more detail on scenario based questions I was required to answer and send in prior to the interview. That lasted about 45 minutes before the next interview which was one on one and was primarily about leadership and also lasted 45 minutes. The third interview was two interviewers and was a slew of questions about real examples of the relevant skills and ""why Amazon"" type questions.

I immediately felt uncomfortable and this being odd for someone who excels in connecting with people. The interviewer literally seemed like he/she was reading from a script as pretty basic questions were asked about my background in a very uninterested manner. As I explained my previous positions, the interviewer couldn't understand what my duties were even after explaining it twice in great detail. I couldn't believe it. It took up almost 20 minutes to finally get the interviewer to understand my experience at one job. In my opinion, I believe the interviewer did not have any kind of background in music business, as he/she struggled to understand my experiences and couldn't move on from the topic. Part of the role of a good and effective interviewer is one who can keep the conversation flowing and know when to move on. This interviewer did not possess any such skills and to me, the interview at no point felt like it had a steady rhythm.

"The initial phase consisted of a phone interview from a recruiter in the Seattle office followed by another phone interview from an Operations manager located in the Las Vegas Office. I was then flown out to Phoenix, Arizona a day before the interview. The hotel and rental car was paid for because it was some pretty good driving. Also Amazon paid for any other travel related expenses. Anyway, the next day had to drive to the Amazon fulfillment center which was pretty new and still growing but was the biggest building I have ever been in. I have an industrial background so that says a lot. The interview started off with a two algebraic questions and was given a very short time to answer and I could tell all of the interviewees were stumbling! Next was a field trip of the building with an Area Manager and we were allowed to ask as many questions as we wanted. This was followed by three interviews with two of them consisting of two people and the last with one person (HR Manager). This company is all about culture and if they feel you don't fit in you will not be offered employment. What I found frustrating is that they keep asking you the same questions over and over again and its like how many times do you need to hear the same answers. If you are not answering the questions according to how they feel you should then the attitudes start to change. At the end of about 4 hours I was told that I would receive a call the next Tuesday which never came. I sent them an e-mail again expressing my interest in the job and received a call the next day stating that I had not been extended an offer. Now this is the kicker, I have years of experience managing a workforce and an environment ten times the stress any work day at Amazon could cause. I also possess a degree in Business Management but experience and education was not much of a concern. I even asked the HR Manager does Amazon encourage further learner (hence continuous personal growth and development) and her answer was no! What company doesn't not want to encourage further growth whether professionally or personally.....On top of this the day I flew home Amazon booked my flight so I had to sit in the airport for 4 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!! On an ending note, obviously none of the other candidates were offered the position because just a few weeks ago the re-posted the position on all of the major job sites.

"Started with the 1st of two phone interviews. The 1st phone interview was about 40 minutes. Pretty standard questions about your resume and situations/tasks you've had in your prior positions. About two days later I received a call from the recruiter who set up the 1st interview. The recruiter was very disorganized. She actually thought she was calling me for the first time and I had to remind her that we spoke a couple times before and that it was her that set up my 1st phone interview. The 2nd interview was an extension of the 1st phone interview. ""Explain your answers thoroughly. STAR approach to answering the questions will help you"". A week or so went by without any word back from Amazon and then I received an e-mail from the recruiter who I'd been in communication (poor) with throughout the process. After replying to the e-mail and not receiving a confirmation, I finally received a confirmation for the ""face-to-face"" interview(s). The ""face-to-face"" interview lasted almost 5 hours. I was rotated from one interviewer to the next. Each last about 45 minutes. The questioning was very similar to the phone interviews, but they will throw at you an interviewer who is NOT from the team for the position that you're interviewing for...known as the ""Bar Raiser"". You may have heard of various differing past stories about the Bar Raiser. My experience with the B.R. was a pleasant one. Once again, understand the STAR technique to answering questions and you should be fine. The interviewer's are a little quirky, socially delayed (they were most likely the last ones picked on the play ground for teams), and they just stare at you at the completion to answering their questions. Don’t be thrown off your game, be confident in your answers, don’t doubt yourself…it’s them not you.

"Most likely talked to a terribly disgruntled recruiter. She literally spent 45 minutes on the phone to make me withdraw my application while it was way above her current team's qualifications according to LinkedIn. The call basically was about why with all the impeccable qualifications that she had to admit, I shouldn't pursue the process without even a phone screen. She explained how the climate was so horrible in Dublin, how much I should hate it, how groceries were as expensive as in London, how real estate had become as expensive as in London, how this role will be all after hours while it was not, why I should not travel, why my kids shouldn't go to school over there, how their taxes were so high ...funny when I paused her to share that our tax rates were actually higher at home she quickly she mumbled ""well...."" and turned to another reason not to consider AWS in Dublin as though she had a list of reasons prepared to bump qualified candidates...and her negative rants went on for ~45 minutes. I left the call rattled and literally sick to my stomach while wondering if one despised their employer or the hiring manager so much why would she still stay with them and convey the grudge to external candidates?

"I applied online, received an email that they would like to schedule an interview. Interestingly I never got a call from the recruiter. I networked with a Sr. Product Manager via LinkedIn, so I was able to prep with him. 1) 60-min First Interview was with a peer manager via Chime. All behavioural questions about 14 LPs. I prepared around 25-30 stories in advance so it wasn't too hard, but the interviewer really digs for details. I just imagined she was my peer at work, so it was fun! 2 days later, got the news that I passed and submitted my availability for 2nd interview. 2mins later I got the confirmation for 2nd interview date and time. 2) 2nd 60-min interview with another peer manager. She was slightly more stoic to my replies, but was respectful. Again, 5~7 behavioural questions. It's quite intense. You have to think fast, answer concise and to the point. 2 days later, I was told that they would like to schedule the loop interview with 5 interviewers. Here they give you an option to split into 2 days or have it in one. I decided to do it in one day (much better to finish it in one go). Again, I submitted my availability and within the day, the coordinator sent me the loop interview schedule. Given the current circumstances, this was again on Chime, but this time with video. Also there was a 2.5) writing assignment to be submitted before the loop (1~2 pager about topics related to 14LP) 3) LOOP interviews. There are many reviews on the internet (reddit, quora, blind etc) about ""bar-raisers"" but I personally thought all interviewers were equally engaging & friendly.

"First phone screen was a great conversation about real world challenges and the take home test was ok, like other trivia algorithm tests. Then on the tech phone screen another trivia algorithm on leetcode and I struggled with the first approach and it caused the refusal. At the end I was able to get a proper solution (had to test it after the conversation, of course), but it was a refusal. They are still using trivia algorithms on interviews, so my advice for those who are trying an opportunity there is to exercise a lot two things: trivia algorithms and code without testing. The second one was hard for me because I use tests all the time and this kinds of make your mind flow go in a different direction (more experimental approach) then writing code without running it. What is required on this kind of interview is an academic approach, requiring you to come out with a solution without experimenting different approaches. No refactoring, code design or testing skills were assessed at all, so the main thing is that you need to know by heart solutions for most of the trivia algorithms you can.

"I am writing this review because I think its important for Amason to review their interview process. This has probably been my worst interview experience ever. Initially, I thought that Amazon would have an interview standard that is similar to Google, Salesforce and other top companies but I can report that they are seriously lacking in people skills. I have interviewed for Amazon 2 times and one time I spoke to a recruiter who was rude so I decided to not continue the interview process and hence declined the next step. - The second time I interviewed with Amazon was 6 months later through a referral process. This was disgracefully bad. I never spoke to a recruiter throughout this process, the recruiter only emailed me to set up multiple interviews (sometimes taking a week or so to reply..) The first interview was with an Account manager who started every sentence with ""we use the star method here at amazon ... can you tell me about a time where you.... did A B C"" - sure of course I can, but it would be nice for us to introduce ourselves and maybe have some small talk before you jump in. You would never conduct a sales meeting like that so why are you interviewing like that? - I highly recommend that Amazon review their interview process as this will not attract top talent. The second interview I had was with the hiring manager, who also did not try to sell Amazon or himself to me but rather told me that he didn't care for introductions as he had my CV in front of him... Again, he said a mere hello and began interrogating me. Hence, from that point on I did not take the interview process seriously. After the interview, I decided that I will not be moving forward as I want to work at a company where I can refer people into the company. Based on my own interview experience I would be too embarrassed to do so.", Please use the Star method to answer the following question: please tell me about a deal that you recently closes where you were faced with adversity?   ,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,Amazon

"After the two initial phone screenings I had the most horrible experience. Less than 24 hours the logistics and one interviewer changed. During the loop the only two local team members were binary opposites to the amazon principles. I even reached out to my recruiter to express my ambiguity and discomfort on how these two rounds went. Five days after they were supposed to get back on the outcome, I emailed the recruiter who chose to ignore my emails and follow ups for for about two weeks. I ended up learning that I was rejected by looking at the job application site despite the fact of everyone during the loop emphasizing on the five business day turnaround and HR getting back regardless of the hire / no hire. Amazon's principles have become wall hangers - they should walk the talk if they are truly the earth's most customer obsessed company being accountable to let people know on a timely manner what the decision was despite the no feedback policy. Thankfully I got the post on site survey request and was able to share all my negative experience regardless of the lack of communication on whether I'd continue under consideration or not. There is a total lack of ownership also on the hiring team's end, after reading the feedback I got an apologetic call from the recruiter saying he was too busy and on a business trip and didn't know why I never got a note on the decision - This call was triggered due to the survey's feedback and not because he truly cared to close the loop. If amazon truly walked the talk, I'd expect a call from the hiring team given the aggraviting incidents I encountered with two of the interviewers. No wonder why this particular role has been open for more than a year - and they still haven't figure out that two of the parties interviewing skills are ""garbage in garbage out"" approach. The questions are non sense, not applicable to replying them through the STAR style, and carried out in Spanish - I'm sure by now they must only contribute towards obstructing and blocking candidates to probably further their careers taking advantage on the backfill gap. I even nailed the background of one of the nasty interviewers from having supported the account on my early stage of my career, which was confirmed by the recruiter on his apology call and he also confirmed there was a track of negative interview feedback on this individual. So having seven people spending more than 315 minutes does not provide assurance that the bar is raised and a proper fit is chosen. Recruiter also mentioned actions were being rolled out to prevent negative experiences for other candidates due to this interviewer's style. I am sorry to have gone through such a lengthy process and getting to meet three great role models to later find out during the loop that two of my potential peers were far away from each principle. Out of respect for the other interviewers, I did not withdraw my application as I appreciated my initial recruiter coordinator effort in setting up the logistics, which at the end were blown up by two people who added an extra ton inclining the scale to a negative experience.", What is your salary expectation?

"First phone interview was a bliss. Easy going senior technician, some questions were difficult,some not. However interviewer gave a very positive vibe even when I wasnt able to answer. All in all very good feeling afterwards. Second phone interview was completely opposite. Interviewer FO had echo on the line, sounded like he was ringing me from the colocation room. Asked politely twice to reconnect or improve connection. Did not help. Within first 5 minutes I had an impression that interviewer has other more important things to do, rather than talk to me, no answers were accepted unless it was word by word from a book. Almost like he did not know himself, only QA in front of him. ""Deep diving"" is one of the slogans for amazon. Unfortunately he seemed to understand it in his own perverted way. There were subjects that I had no knowledge about, which I notified my interviewer, however he carried on asking questions within the same subject. When I asked why are we going through with this, when I said I'm not familiar with this. He claimed deep diving *facepalm*. He ended up raising his voice and getting very impatient. I do not tolerate such behaviour and asked him to calm down and that there is no reason to get upset. Explained my answers etc. He ended interview after that, simply said that will be all.

"I am from India and I applied to AWS Vancouver from Linkedin, in a couple of days got an invite from the recruiter for a coding challenge, problems were easy to the medium level I easy moved to next stage which was phone interview interviewer was super nice and asked me medium level coding question. I cleared that round and they invited me to Vancouver for an onsite interview, initially, I was confused why are they inviting me to Canada for 4-5 hour interview there are multiple offices of Amazon in India and they could have easily taken interview from India itself. Regardless I started the visa application process and other logistics for my travel to Canada I had to pay for Canadian visa, food and taxi myself initially (although I am still waiting for my reimbursement from Amazon). The moment I landed in Vancouver it was a gloomy cold rainy day and immediately my next thought was I don't like it I don't want to come here to work for a significant amount of time. Onsite day, the first interview was completely non-technical with the manager and he asked me lots of boring LP questions (at the end of my 6th interview I was more exhausted because of these LPs rather than technical questions, one of my main motivation to apply and appear for amazon was to face challenging technical and coding questions but that wish was not fulfilled at all). The second was coding plus LP questions round, third was lunch round (it was an unofficial round where I had lunch with an amazon developer, during this meeting I asked him multiple questions about Tech-Stack and work culture etc. additionally I also asked him about on-call (i think he suddenly became sad explaining me about that :) ). Next round was Bar raiser but basically, it was completely technical round, then design round and then object-oriented design round. I seriously felt that I have answered all technical and LPs as expected. All the questions felt easy and I also covered all the edge cases the interviewer asked me to handle.

"Applied online. Was selected to do phone interview with person from team (not HR). Ran smoothly. Was selected to return for all day interview (5 separate interviews back to back with a lunch break. Had pre-interview HR meeting to tell me what to expect. Within that meeting recruiter asked me my salary expectations/current salary; which I thought was unusual as their policy appears to say the opposite on their website (they don't use this in their offer process). I was told I was towards the top end of their range etc. but they would be competitive. Interview day was gruelling enough with a good many questions requiring the same answer. I felt I did well but fielding 60-70 questions I probably stumbled 2 or 3 times but was difficult because interviewer did not understand the business I was coming from. Turned out that really the role was a senior project manager at best and although I may have accepted it if offered it was beneath my competency level. One thing to note is that Amazon seem to have two main roles of Product Manager and Program Manager. Between these two roles Business Analysis, Project Management, Test Management are covered so if you are used to having resources supporting you as a Program Manager or a Senior Project Manager a Program Manager role in Amazon may not be for you. I think Amazon place over emphasis on the Leadership principles rather than trying to see if the person actually has done this job before and thus can add value to the company. They also have a weird policy that if you wish to go to the bathroom that you must be followed by your interviewer not into the bathroom but waiting outside. It is demeaning for employees to have to do that and that should be rethought. Finally I received a call from HR a couple of days later telling me I was unsuccessful. He gave me some brief feedback which did not rhyme true with how the interview went; reality is that I wasn't a good fit (too experienced and at the top of their range) but I understand that no company will provide candid feedback and thus give generic comments.

"I was approached by an HR person from Amazon via linked in. I was told the role was more management than technical. The role was new in the Berlin office. I was interviewed on the phone by a CSM in the UK. He asked me some behavioral questions (see below) and some random technical questions. I made it very clear that I did not have a technical background. He avoided my questions on this topic. This was followed up with a longer discussion with HR in Berlin. Again, I reiterated the point regarding lack of hands-on technical experience. Again, a response from Amazon was avoided. Approx 3 weeks later I submitted a technical test (choice of 2 questions - your best innovation or a time when you had to make an instant decision with no analysis) and attended 5 interviews in the Amazon office. 3 were face to face and 2 via VC (with 2 architects, another CSM, an engineer from another team and an account manager). In the technical interview, I again asked if I would be exposed alone to the customer in technical discussions or whether I would have backup from a solution architect or similar. Again, the question was sidestepped. One week later, I had received no response and had to chase Amazon HR. The decision was rejection due to insufficient technical ability.", 4 of the the 5 face to face interviews were behavioral interviews - i.e. specific examples from previous work experience were required.

"Recruiter reached out to me for a hiring event (onsite) to be scheduled at Pune location. I expressed my concern to the recruiter about having less than a week's time for prep. I was assured that I can always try again, if the interview doesn't workout. On the day of interview, candidates were handed over a written test. We needed to write down solution for a data structure/algorithm problem. I solved it and submitted my answer to their team. Surprisingly, I and two other candidates were told that we didn't clear it. Now, I knew that my solution was correct and hence, requested for a feedback. After waiting for an hour, I was told that in fact I had cleared and the reviewers did not understand that the solution was written in a different language ( read 'python') as they use java and c++. I gasped with humor and mixed feelings, with this being my first red flag for the 'Hiring Event'. After that I faced two more rounds. Managerial round was okay. It was more of a conversation with the SD manager, which went fine. In the technical interview, I successfully solved the first question, struggled with the second question but had a solution to it (may be not what expected by the interviewer). The ideal solution was related to topological sort, which I knew at the first glance, but did not want to go that route, as I didn't recall the algorithm. I solved the third question also, with lot of interaction with the interviewer. I didn't clear this round. Now, my understanding of onsite interview is that, you undergo 4 to 5 rounds and eventually a decision is made based on feedback from all the rounds. This event felt more like a filler event, where I was not sure if they wanted to hire anyone at the end. Each interview was like an elimination round. Sad part is, even if you perform well, there's no guarantee. The interviewers follow their book and are least open to listening to solutions which are not in front of them on their laptop.

"I felt like a complete waste of time, after 2 weeks, 4 phone interviews + 6 in person at the AWS Luxembourg office, they've hired an insider, they might just needed some outside applications to validate their hiring process. Apart from the first interview with the Recruiter, who was very professional, the rest of discussions and encounters were robotic, unhumane almost. The process is rigid and does not have the flow you will find in the IT industry, there will be no questions about you, hobbies, work-life balance. Keep in mind, all interviews (phone and in person) have a sort of transcript. The interviewer is typing while also listening to you and for a lot of them I felt this was a struggle, not all are typist skilled and it does affect the overall process not to mention you are talking to a person who is just starring in the screen. You need to talk very slow to allow them to catch up with typing, you need to respond in absolute STAR technique, anything else will derail them from filling up the form and it's a pain for them and you . Although the position was for AWS sales with no technical requirements, there were lots of technical questions, network components definitions mainly. The 6 interviews I had in person in Luxembourg were exhausting, different people will ask you the same thing and not all interviewers have the same business experience or interest in being in that room with you, so the assessment it's awkward.

"The interview process was first the online application form, along with a SJT - Situational Judgement Test (answer according to what the employer wants to hear, e.g. I will stay late to finish a task rather than go home, I work well under pressure - strongly agree etc). I then completed a basic maths spreadsheet test, which looked similar to the official Amazon worksheets for managers. It was all numbers and percentages based and that test was actually easy. I then had to complete another Maths SHL test online which was really tough. I guessed all the answers and totally messed it up. But surprisingly they didn't seem to care at all because I was already offered to attend the final interview even before completing this SHL Maths test which was weird. I think their recruiter messed up haha. I had my final interviews at a fulfilment centre. The first two interviews were really easy, super chill and relaxed. I used the STAR method and the interviewers guided you along to get your answers out of you. So if you forget to say something you've prepared, they actually help you to get the answers. If you prepare sample answers for the interviews, you will do well. Interview questions were similar to the ones other people have posted on this website e.g. tell me about a time you used data to make a tough decision, when were you faced with ambiguity, when were you out of your comfort zone, what was a difficult task you had to complete within strict time limits and how did you manage to stay on track, when did you use data and went against management and how did they react etc. Check other glassdoor reviews too, the questions are almost similar. The last interviewer was super tough, and no nonsense however. He asked hard questions and kept saying how do you expect to practically translate what you're saying to me during this interview onto the actual warehouse floor e.g. how are you going to engage with your staff? Step by Step explain etc. So I just said I am very friendly and open to hear their concerns, I have great communication and interpersonal skills as evidenced, and I won't be looking at my laptop when they are asking me questions etc. Finally I did a tour of the FC and I went home thinking I messed up the interview because the last interviewer was super tough, but surprisingly I got the job. They called me the next day and I was literally expecting a phone call telling me I wasn't getting the job, but it was the opposite! They offered me a much higher wage than expected too (especially straight out of Uni, only Aldi and Lidl pay more within the retail sector and the logistics sector).

"The interview process was similar to what you can read here on glassdoor. However, what I want to add is that your background and experience has NOTHING to do with what you will be tested for.

I applied on the company website and I received an email by the recruiter a couple of weeks later. First, I performed a (not so difficult) code challenge on a well known code site. Then, we scheduled a screen call, where the recruiter asked me basic computer science questions and my previous experiences. We immediately scheduled an on-site interview (EVERYTHING was paid by the company, just keep the receipts). The recruiter suggested me a lot of things to prepare myself as best as I could (everything in line with the book that I was reading). The room where I did the interview was pretty small, but everything was pretty new and gave me a good sensation. The interviewer were very professional and also friendly. I struggled with the last problem, but with a little help of the interviewer, I figured out how to provide an efficient solution. The behavioral question are half of the interview, I strongly suggest to well prepare yourself on them. After one week, I received a phone call where the recruiter told me that I passed the interview (what an amazing feeling!). In my opinion, it has been a good experience (even though a little bit stressful and with a tons of small steps and calls).

They cannot assess product, brand, trends, customer knowledge with these questions. The first interviewer admitted they had been looking for a while- I am not surprised!! The recruitment contact wasn't helpful at all- I asked a couple of simple questions before my 2nd interview and never got any replies. Pretty rude as I had invested a lot of time myself. Then when I was asked to come in to meet with Amazon I said that I had accepted a role elsewhere (it was a full day off needed, with 3-4 interviews I was told)- I then really politely explained that I didn't feel the questions asked so far were creative/ fashion/ trend related at all (They didn't even ask me what trends were key, what brands I like or anything), and that the role wasn't what was really being advertised. They wanted someone who had done design/ buying/ merchandising/ trend/ multi product/ branded/ own brand/ product development/ manufacturing.... then asked for a 2 page business plan as if I were launching a brand.

What I found was that the interviewer was more set on the exact program management methodology that they were used to and not inclined to any other path. I ask specific questions that were not answered to my liking and was given answers which were the same answers that I gave although my answer was deemed the incorrect. I truly believe that the interviewer was not listening to any of the answer that I was giving and was intimidated by my skill-set because my skill set was definitely higher than what the position required.

I got the call on friday and asked me to come next day itself. Altough i was not looking for a job change, but i said yes for interview. All rounds were really very easy.

Hiring manager seemed really impressed by my current role. If you are already working at good package in product based company, then you already have a lead over candidates from service based company. I cleared 4 rounds on that day. Next week, i was called for bar raiser round. I think, the interviewer had some confusion regarding the role. All questioned asked focused on managerial skills where as profile was that of QAE-2. All questions asked did'nt had a definite answer, they were subjective to people thinking, for ex, you consider that issue is critical, but developer don't consider it critical- how would you convince him or you are releasing with some known issues, would you inform your client about known issues. They won't be asking you anything other than their fixed set of questions. I have knowledge of python, shell scripts, servers, git, maven, jenkins,jmeter, but nothing would be asked.

I got call from Amazon recruiter saying my resume is shortlisted for senior tech. program manager. And first round they sent assignment via mail about business scenario and asked few questions related to this I have spent time 2 hr and answered and sent the updated document. I got call from Amazon,Bangalore recruiter saying I was scheduled face to face round at Amazon office near MG road,Bangalore . I reached MG road at 12 PM and first round is technical round with questions on design, architecture etc. and question on design of online portal etc . Its around 1 hr and after this HR person asked me to wait for further rounds . And they provided packaged lunch at their office. 2nd round started at 1 PM and questions on team management,project mgmt etc. 3 rd round for 45 mins to 1 hr and questions on project mgmt, innovative things I have done etc. 4th round again some repetitive questions on project mgmt .

It took around 2 hrs to reach that place from Outer ring road,bangalore. 5th round I was asked about questions related to my project architecture,conflict mgmt and project mgmt etc. it's for around 1 hr.After this recruiter told they will provide feedback within 3 or 4 days .And I got mail saying ""we regret that we do not have a suitable opening at present that does justice to your aspirations and capabilities Hence we would not be able to take it forward at this juncture."" I applied 2 days leave to office to attend interviews. Initial assignment which was never talked or discussed in interviews :(. Amazon can spend lot of time on interviews as they can afford but we cannot spend that much time. They provided cab pickup/drop facility.My suggestion try amazon only after you have offer from another company . As after spending this much time you will be disappointed if you didn't get through.:(", what was most innovative technical work you have done   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,Amazon

"I contacted a recruited via LinkedIn and then I was put forward for a new Amazon program, the Military Leader Program in the US. First you get a phone screen interview with HR or Recruiter. I passed that then I was phone interviewed by a Senior Operations Manager, as I didn't reside in the location they were looking at me for. I passed that and next was put forward to a conference call phone interview with a panel of Senior Operations Managers, HR, and General Managers, 4 total with about 3-4 tell me about a time questions. There was no math question for this position. Up until the last panel interview things seemed professional and on track, but the last interview was pure chaos on their end, they were behind and seemed like they were just going through the motions with me. However, it appears to be a highly competitive program as they are only hiring 75 in 2017 nationwide. They could've just been a bit more organized on their end.", Same as for an Operations Manager position.

"On that day nearly 1000+ students have appeared for the interview and it took nearly 4 hours for me to enter into the first round which is JAM.The job is for experienced as well as freshers and I am a fresher. When we entered the room where JAM is taking place the H.R who is very friendly asked us to introduce about ourselves and later he personally asked each one of us various questions to test our communication skills. 22 people are there including me, nearly 7 people are experienced and remaining are freshers. Most of the people are feeling it difficult to speak in English nearly 8-10 have answered well. On completing he said that only one is selected and we are sorry you all are rejected better try next time after six months and the one who is selected is with experience but he is the one who feels it difficult to speak in english. He hasn't answered the questions properly and yet he is selected which is a big shock for us.", How did you solve the problem with a customer whose product has not delivered on the expected date which he has ordered for his friend&#039;s b&#039;day?   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,Amazon
