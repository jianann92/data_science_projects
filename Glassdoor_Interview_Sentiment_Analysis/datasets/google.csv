,No Offer,Negative Experience,,"I never write any reviews for interviews. However I felt compelled to do so after speaking to a lady from my current job that had an almost similar experience. From initial application to interview it took about 3 months. I thought I would share my experience since hopefully Google reads this. The men that interviewed me where all of similar ethnicity/race. My first interviewer refused to shake my hand (pre-covid). After that I was mature enough to immediately know it was not going to go well. The next interviewers asked me question, which i responded to well, that were above the scope of the role. I could almost see they were frustrated by my responses whatever they may be. Honestly I really just wanted to get out and was thinking of excuses, but I stayed because I am an adult and was not going to immaturely walk out (although I was obviously being discriminated for either my race, sex, or who knows what else). There are probably a lot of groups where this crap happens, but am hopeful with a company this big that some sort of massive leadership changes occur. Right now I don’t ever want to apply again at Google and go through this. It’s a waste of everyone’s time. They should just put a sign up no X or Y and Z allowed inside so at least we all save ourselves some time.",Google

 write code to generate iid draws from distribution X when we only have access to a random number generator   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"Sailed through the initial phone interview (a series of technical stats questions) and then moved to a virtual onsite. This was 5 back to back 45min interviews with other employees, and no break in between sessions. With one exception, everyone seemed rushed, unhappy, and totally uninterested in their work. One interviewer was nearly impossible to communicate with bc of echoing sounds on mic and poor English language skills. It was live coding and or doing math in a Google doc for 90% of the time on complex problems that interviewers seemed to expect a quick simple answer for, rather than a discussion of trade-offs under different scenarios. Responses to my follow up questions were generally misleading or unhelpful. The most useless ""brain teaser"" task was to derive the CDF of an exotic distribution I had not worked with before but could simply be looked up in 2s on Wikipedia. This came after three other questions I had already solved. I'm not sure what they're selecting on here but it was a genuinely bad experience and the interview day provided a strong signal that it would not be a good fit for me. Not surprised about the outcome, but it was a real waste of my time and the recruiter provided zero feedback about the rejection because of ""NDA policy"".",Google

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I received an email from Google approximately 1 week after I submitted my resume. The recruiter scheduled a phone interview for me two weeks out with confirmations. The morning of the interview, the recruiter reached out to wish me good luck, and to contact him immediately following the interview. The interviewer never showed up. I immediately connected my recruiter 15 minutes after the start time with no response. After an hour went by, I connected my recruiter again - no response. The recruiter did not get back to me until the next morning apologizing for his late reply - never apologized or provided an explanation for the no-show. I was rescheduled for later that week. The interviewer did show up this time; however, was very dry. There were no formal introductions, and I was not given an opportunity to provide any information relating to my professional experience. The interviewer went straight into his 4 questions and it was a robotic like experience (which is ironic because some of his questions were based on robots). He kept saying, 'interesting' after each of my answers, and I felt defeated and didn't give much more effort.

Also, although ""coding"" wasn't in the job description, they usually give any technical position (and this was mostly program management and partner relationship development) a CODING INTERVIEW. I haven't coded since college, however they will give it to you anyway. Also, they rescheduled THREE of the interviews the day of the interview which made things a bit frustrating.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"If I had to describe Google's interview process in one word, I would say ""insane."" The number of interviews and different hoops you have to jump through is out of this world. I applied for a position with the company online and received an email from a recruiter about 2 weeks after that. The recruiter expressed their interest in speaking further with me about the position. She set up a date and time for a brief introductory call. During that call, she asked me a few questions. Nothing difficult. She was taking notes and reading questions from a document someone else sent her. Honestly speaking, she seemed to not be upbeat about the work she was doing. She took alot of long deep breaths during the call as if she had been working a 12 hour shift. When I asked her questions about the position, she told me that she did not know any details and that I could ask the person I would be speaking to on the next call. A few weeks after, I spoke to someone else (over the phone). Again, taking notes while on the call. So I felt in a sense he was not really listening and taking in what I was saying. He told me he was exhausted and was pretty tired from working alot of hours each day and constant travel to include international. Like the interview before, the questions he asked were pretty easy surrounding project management based related tasks. I know I did well and felt very comfortable. I was able to explain the in's and out's of project management based upon my past experiences and were able to communicate them. The recruiter told me I would know in a few days whether I would be moving to the next phase of the interview process or not. The recruiter called almost 2 weeks later informing me that I would not be moving forward. If I had to say why I was not selected to move forward, maybe it was the whole ""googlely"" personality that the company speak of. I've been hearing and reading about what people have said about google's hiring practices and it appears to me that there is a lack of diversity and inclusion. Someone that I know who use to work for Google said at the Mountainview location, you could go days without seeing a person of color. That's insane! Google's typical sought out hires are younger white individuals straight out of college. Even the google interview reviews on Youtube reflect a bunch of young aged individuals recently graduated that have quit their jobs at Google because either they have gotten bored or feel like they are not getting enough attention by management. I think its reckless on Google's part to hire a company full of individuals that are not seeking stability and longevity. Or...maybe Google wants to hire a bunch of new college graduates to keep new folks rolling in and out every 2 years. Either way, people of color and those over a certain age stand a hard days chance in hell getting hired by Google. I have over 15 years of experience and a person of color...I knew in the back of my mind things wouldn't go far. Oh well, that's just Google's lost! If I had to give advice to Google about their interview process and hiring practices, I would say, DO BETTER! For those interviewing with Google to later learn 2 months down the road that you are not moving forward, it is not the end of the world. Keep going!",Google

Also, the last engineer was not as talkative as the other two, which was already was a red flag since he didn't seem all that interested in me or the interview. The rejection notice was pretty slow too; took a few weeks so I suppose that is to be expected of the rejected individuals at google. This company is a hit or miss and will auto reject you if you reapply later (even with more referrals) within a certain time period which is kind of dumb if you ask me since they demand more experience in software development which maybe their engineers should also get before interviewing...

There was an initial phone screener with the HR person, then a follow up phone interview with my potential manager. After that I was invited to an in-person interview that was four hours without breaks, with four different interviewers - two peers, two more senior. In each interview, the interviewer clearly set up that they would type while they talked to me and that there were some pretty specific rules they had to follow and questions they had to ask. The interviews felt stiff and formal as a result, particularly because despite assurances there was no ""right"" answer, it often felt as if I'd answered it wrong. Had heard about Google's hiring practices like this, but generally left that day feeling really defeated by questions that felt irrelevant to my potential rolee.

A mix of some friendly and some intimidating jerkish engineers. One interviewer used some intimidating words ('Be careful') whenever he thought there was a mistake in an interface I was asked to define, a guy who said 'we have already done this', pulled of shaking hands with me in a rude way (I accidentally had done the gesture apparently already once), couple of cases the English language of the engineers who interviewed were bad enough that I could not understand their question or not sure if they understood my analysis when he/she gave feedback. Overall, the process felt the engineers want to prove why those engineers are in Google( and why they are convinced that these interviews ) and why most others coming into interview should not be. In one case, another employee was annoyed that my interviewer was staying in the conference room too long when he was banging the door. So, when we came out of the interview the other guy started yelling that he had to wait so long and could not get into his meeting. At the end of the interview came out with the feeling this place has more baggage of bad personalities and churn of the mill imperfect humans instead of 'I want to work at the places where all modern complex distributed systems problems where solved impacting average person in the world.'",Google

 Talk about a time when you failed.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I had a 45 minute interview with a Google employee. Based on what I've heard through reviews and through other employees, I thought this interview would generally be okay. The interview itself wasn't bad, BUT that was by far the WORST INTERVIEWER I have ever encountered. I am actually really shocked at the lack of professionalism of the interviewer. He was 15 minutes late to the interview and it felt like he was in a rush and didn't want to interview me. In other interviews I've had in the past, it always felt like a conversation, but this time it felt like the interviewer didn't care about what I had to say at all and he was super monotone. At the end of the interview, he didn't even allow me to ask additional questions I had about the position and about himself and actually HUNG UP ON ME. I get that he was in a rush and that he probably has better things to do than interview an intern, but still, I felt so disrespected and upset after the call. From the beginning of the call, I got this kind of ""off-putting"" feeling from the interviewer and it really threw me off from the start. And, I think that really affected the rest of my interviewer. I know Google is a great company, so I was really really shocked at how terrible, and honestly slightly disrespectful, this interviewer was.",Google

Started with an online application, sent my resume not expecting very much. Got a response, was requested to complete an online survey plus timed coding exercise. The exercise was pretty straightforward, some strings manipulation and 1D array manipulation (fruit basket leetcode). Made it to the next round, phone interview over Google Docs with an engineer. This part I was shocked at how simple the questions were, delete every other elem from a linked list and some really easy strings question. I felt pretty confident afterwards, had to follow up with my recruiter a couple times to help advance things along. Finally, the onsite in Pittsburgh, had to do 4 whiteboarding technical interviews with lunch in between. For me at least I wasn't asked any system design questions or anything related to my resume, just straight up questions out of leetcode or ICPC. I felt like I nailed two but encountered turbulence doing the other two, managed a satisfactory coded solution on all but one. They give you the option to do it either on the whiteboard or on a chromebook connected to a projector. One of the questions was really poorly formed and I had trouble communicating with the engineer who asked it of me, but the others were all well understood and clear problems. I don't recommend taking bathroom breaks mid interview like I did or you will feel short on time (45 min per.) Two weeks later I got a phone call stating I wasn't a ""good match"".

 Make a product for kids   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"An on-site interview in MV that has in-person and virtual interviewers (even though all of the interviewers were nearby on-campus in MV). You check-in, someone comes to get you, you interview back-to-back for several 40-45min sessions. Someone comes to get you for lunch. Then more back-to-back interviews. Though they claim it's super unique, that part of the process is very similar to other tech company interviews. The only difference is that it is 100% analytical and tech focused. It's also very rushed. Surprisingly, the majority of my interviews were rapid fire questions rather than a conversation. None of which were ""give me a time where"" or ""when have you ever"". Don't expect questions to get to know what you've done, how you did it, what you've proven. It's not a part of the process, don't expect anyone to want to get to know about your experience, accomplishments, failures, etc. They don't talk about any of that. The interview process might have been conducted a bit smoother as there were several tech issues and coordination issues throughout my interview day. The interviewers could have been more ""present"" and less rushed as well, but they might have been trying to make up for the time lost in-between each interview due to the various technical and coordination issues that popped up throughout the day.

 Legally I cannot disclose any questions that they asked.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online for this position. Soon after I was contacted by a recruiter for an initial phone interview. The first phone interview will be about 20-30 minutes. This interview is really just to get to know more about you, go over different areas of your resume and to discuss your past experiences to see if you'd be a good fit for this specific role. If you're selected, you will be contacted again (1-2 days later) by the recruiter to set up 2 back to back phone interviews (1 with a manger of that department you'd work for, and 1 with someone who currently occupies that role). The questions they ask range between behavioral questions, some situational, and some that you simply cannot prepare for - so do not over analyze this. Use your knowledge and ability to come up with answers to their questions. They don't have a specific ""right"" answer, so take your time to gather your thoughts and jot some ideas down before answering, they will appreciate that instead of someone who is rambling. After this interview, you will be contacted to move forward and will be invited for an on-site interview. This is very similar to the back to back phone interviews (1 manager for a half hour, and 1 with an employee who currently occupies the role you are applying for). One of my on-site interviews happened to be a google hangout (video call interview) - which was actually very cool to experience (never had an interview like this before). The questions they ask are similar to the categories listed above. After your on-site interviews you will be given a tour and you'll head home. You will hear back from the team within a 1-3 weeks if you are offered a position! They aren't making their decision solely on how you answer questions, so try not to be a well-rehearsed robot.

I do not think Google used a proper and intelligent way to find right talents for their teaching positions at GCC. The negative feedback from the problem solving interview was nothing to do with logical problem solving. Rather, the feedback was that I was not able to articulate my philosophy during the interview. I was quite puzzled that my philosophy of teaching was stated the same as GCC since I am working there as a TVCs, and I found a lot of common ground when I work in the classrooms. In my work, I have gotten a lot of positive feedback and relationships with children, educators and parents. Also, the interviewer did not give me sufficient time to articulate my philosophy because she left this question at nearly the end of the interview. I questioned the recruiter to give me more specific feedback regarding my philosophy of teaching, and she said it was Google's policy that she was not able to discuss more. Overall, I did not like the negative hiring experience with Google because the interview itself did not serve a meaningful purpose to find right talents for the GCC. The feedback from the interview was irrelevant to the interview, which was a problem solving interview. The feedback sounded to me more like an excuse rather than a sincere feedback.

Once again, he got back with me the very next day to tell me that they wanted to move forward in presenting my candidacy to the hiring committee. He had a few additional employment questions and then he presented my candidacy four days later. The hiring committee got back to my recruiter six days later and he got back with me that same day to present my offer. In preparation, I would not prep for off the wall crazy questions.

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"The interview process started with an initial phone interview with a recruiter out of their HQ. 2 weeks went by, and then a second phone interview with a different recruiter who was my main POC throughout the process. After 2 more weeks going by, they flew me out to their office for an onsite interview. They provided the flight, hotel and rental, but did not cover any additional expenses. During the onsite interview, I met with 5 people, some of which I was not told I would be interviewing with. Some of those I was informed I'd be interviewing with, I didn't meet with. Each interview with each interviewer was also timed and seemed rushed. Questions were very difficult, and the body language of some of the interviewers was very stand-offish. At the end of the interview, there was no closing or conclusion of the interview, I was just walked to the door and thanked for coming in. Though the interview was positive from my perspective, the atmosphere in the interview made the experience unpleasant and not reassuring. I didn't feel as prepared upon arrival once I realized I would not be interviewing with the people I was told I'd be interviewing with. To recap, I also did not get a chance to meet with my (or any) recruiter regarding next steps and/or follow up, and I was not left with a positive closing of the interview. Overall, though the experience was positive, I have had WAY more positive experiences with other companies for similar positions and was still not offered a position. I was told they decided to hire an internal candidate, but that I would be considered for future positions. I think Google and their opportunities are overhyped because of their brand, but their interview process lacks efficiency and accuracy because of how many hands are in the bucket.",Google

There was a third interview that was a video chat and coding question but I didn't make it that far. The 2 phone interviews I had weren't extremely difficult, but challenged you to use and apply general data structures and algorithms to questions. They allowed language of choice and the interviewers were very friendly and engaged. Didn't pass the second interview but it was a great experience.

For each question the interviewers asked me, I answered quickly, talked through them with the interviewers, and wrote the correct algorithms without mistakes for the most efficient solutions. Both interviewers told me I did a great job, and asked me questions that they said they'd usually ask people applying for the regular software engineering internship instead of the EP. One of the interviewers said to me, ""I'm going to be blunt, these questions were too easy for you"". After all this, I waited about a month to hear back, and I didn't get the internship. Considering that I literally could not have done better on the interview, I felt like the results were determined before I even interviewed.

I had the employee who referred me also email her with no response. Deadline arrived and I accepted the offer from the other company. The next day my recruiter calls me and says sorry, she's been sick. I don't know whether or not this is true because normally when recruiters are sick/out of office they set up one of those automatic-replies on their emails that says, ""Hey, I've been sick, if it's urgent contact person@company.com"".

Two days later, I was scheduled to have a call with my new recruiter to discuss Host Matching. This new recruiter informed that the Hiring Committee would be extended to me an Open Offer. This means that I have the option to accept an offer before I am matched with a host, guaranteeing a job with Google regardless of outcome of Host Matching.

One thing that stood out was the manager that interviewed me. This lady was dressed up much more than the other women in the office. She looked like she was going on a date - high heels, tight pants, curled hair, makeup - the works. She finished graduate school within the past five years (I finished graduate school 15 years ago) and had at least 10 years less experience than I did. As part of the interview process the possibility of me working as a manager came up. Ultimately Google decided I didn't have the past experience to justify a management role. I was offered a position as an engineer and I turned it down. Why? Because the interview panel itself told me what kind of ""manager"" google values. It's pretty clear Google values ""eye candy"" over competency - which means less possibility of career advancement for myself, or even more qualified people for that matter. Then again, Google's products, which have declined in quality IMO, reflect that. This company has turned into another Boeing or Microsoft. So sad.",Google

There is an on-site interview but I don't expect to be called in for that because I did poorly on the phone interview. The recruiter interview was nice -- I was just asked about my interests and why I applied for the position. Pleasant experience. The phone interview was disappointing. I spent two weeks studying very complex algorithms as suggested by the recruiter, and I was prepared with an arsenal of facts and knowledge about data structures and algorithms and LINUX systems and networking and the list goes on. Then, I ended up spending the entire phone interview on one relatively simpleton problem, getting stuck in the nitty gritty details of how to move an index and offset around. It was the kind of question that most programmers could usually do in their sleep, but I was nervous and just jabbered on. The interviewer was nice and polite, but overall I feel the interview style structure is poor and needs to be more varied (how does a blind scientist know that he's touching an elephant if he only feels the toenail?) Based on my experience, I strongly recommend doing Project Euler problems or the like ... although I went through dozens of them and they didn't help me. Theoretically, though, they will. Anyway, bottom line is, don't worry about understanding complex subjects. Just worry about the basics.",Google

They were a little more consumed talking about themselves and their journey, not really interested in yours and how you'd be a fit. It felt as though they've already made a decision before even taking the time to meet. I would not of wasted my time or theirs if this indeed was the reception I was to receive.

Some of them seemed to really want to get to know me and what I could offer, while others seemed to be looking for ""gotchas"" by quizzing me about arcane (non-public) details of their business model and probing for my ignorance. One person brought her dog to the interview, and another had to end the interview early so that she could run to her company sponsored massage. It was one of the most bizarre job interview experiences that I ever had, and it left a very negative impression of what the work would be like should I decide to join there.

He also presented several things incorrectly, such as initially calling a list of numbers a set, which implies no repetitions, but later changing his mind to just a list. I eventually got the question right, but it took the entire length of the phone call and I believe there was another question that he wanted to ask. He also did not give me the 7 extra minutes at the end and kept reminding me that we were almost out of time.

 Common situational and behavioral questions. Remember that this is considered a sales role so expect them to ask you questions about dealing with customers and organizing a sale force.   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"It was a 4 stage interview process and I did not make it past the 3rd stage.

They were very transparent with the role and company and were willing to answer all my questions. Most of the interview questions were behavioral questions that allowed me to demonstrate my thinking strategies. My advice is to learn as much as you can about the company and the role. In addition, you should practice answering case questions that demonstrate your knowledge of business strategy. It's very important for you to be able to think up of a strategy under pressure and explain that strategy in a clear and concise manner.",Google

Since collaborating remotely is, in the opinion of the people who make Hangouts, utterly impossible and I'm stuck outside Silicon Valley (thank god) I turned them down every year. Finally I felt I had the freedom to move to the Bay Area and I said Ok. There was a phone interview which I felt went fine. Then nothing. I didn't hear from them until the following year when the annual traditional solicitation was received anew as if the previous year's phone interview never happened. So I did the phone interview again. Seemed fine again (they do have enough remote collaboration competence to use Google Docs and talk on the phone). They invited me up for an on site interview. I feel like I'd be pretty a pretty good fit at Google. The questions were challenging but not surprising or far outside of my capabilities. I felt like I had a good rapport with all 6 people I talked to (it's a long day). I was calm and comfortable and don't think I blundered anything (while they blundered various scheduling details and room reservations etc; the interviewers clearly hadn't glanced at my resume and knew nothing about me). I left feeling that I had done a pretty good job with the whole exercise. Then a week later or so I get a call (super annoying that they can't just email me the answer) and I was not accepted. But! They told me that I could reapply (I never applied - they contacted me) in 6 to 12 months (whatever that means). I asked why I had been rejected and was told that the reason could not be disclosed. So that left me wondering... If there is a mystery reason that they don't like me, why would I waste my energy messing around with them in 6-12 months? I am assuming that I'm not going to magically learn the thing/behavior they were looking for by luck. But I do have a lot of friends who work there and I do know that some people smarter than I got rejected just like this and they reapplied and then go in. That's a pretty sketchy process IMO.

The next telephonic was set for the following week with another HR personnel which was all about critical thinking questions, no right or wrong answers, they just want to know how you respond! Got feed back the same day from the recruiter stating she received my 'results' from the critical thinking telephonic, and my resume is being passed along internally in finding an available role that might be a strong match for me. And that was it. I was never up for a job per se, I was screened as a potential future candidate for admin roles. Never heard from them again. But the whole experience of being phoned screened was pleasant & accommodating. Bare in mind, I wasn't being interviewed by people in a room, these were just phone conversations for a job that doesn't exist & probably will never hear from them again!",Google

After I originally declined the offer they asked that I think over it some more, after which they offered to see if another department were willing to hire me.

 Case study questions   ,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,,Google
 Why do you want the job?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Google recruiter reached out, did the standard screening -work history, why are you interested in Google/the role. About 6 weeks went by before I got scheduled with a person (not hiring manager) for a phone screen. Similar to phone screen and focused on my work history as person was familiar with role but couldn't get into details as they were not the hiring manager. I provided a couple of dates to fly up to Mountainview. It wasn't overly organized as they didn't confirm the date for my interview (I had provided a variety of dates 2 weeks prior) until 36 hours before the interview date which made it a scramble to make travel arrangements. Google covered flights, food, car and hotel. No advance notice of who I would be speaking to, other than their functions (ie ""you'll be talking to another Director, one of the position's direct reports, etc). Was told to arrive at one building but then was walked to another building a fair bit away for initial interview (same person as phone screen). That went well. I had an interview next with the direct report (in yet another far away building) which also went well . Both were focused on my work history, how I handled certain situations, my outlook on the role (a difficult question to answer when I had still not talked to hiring manager). Next interview was via their video conference system as the person was just returning from a trip. That person proceeded to eat the whole time, while at the same time doing a behavorial question interview that bordered on being combative. I wasn't sure if they were doing a good cop/bad cop routine as part of the hiring process. The final interviewer, a VP, came in about 20 minutes late, told me he had no idea of what the role was and hadn't read my resume. I was asked to go over my work history, then he turned it over to me for questions. Since he couldn't answer questions on role, I tried asking some questions on Google's businesses. He didn't seem interested in talking so we ended interview after 15 minutes. He dropped me off at the door but at that point I had no idea where I was after having moved buildings 3 times. It was about a week before Google came back and let me know they weren't moving forward with me. They did not provide feedback from the interview.",Google

 Lots of questions about manipulating strings and sets of strings.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was contacted by a recruiter. We decided that Boulder in the Google Docs group would be the best fit for my interests and background. The phone interview was fine, although I thought the interviewer was a little bit snarky when I responded to his question on how to improve Docs. I had an onsite interview with 5 different sets of people. A couple of the people were very nice, but I found the others to be rather socially inept. It is a tech company, so I expect this to some extent, but their interview process needs to take this into consideration. Only one person asked a question even remotely related to my work (about decision making and rationality I believe), and he had his set of opinions about it so didn't seem to like what I said. The coding interviews were all very similar- pretty contrived problems designed to test only one's coding knowledge. I went into the interviews believing that they appreciated creative solutions, but realized that if your solution is not one of the handful that they are familiar with, then they are unable to recognize the solution as viable. (Perhaps this is also partly my own fault if I didn't clearly express my idea), but a couple of them seemed very doubtful of anything I came up with. Also, communication problems were an issue. One interviewer asked me to generate a random number. I asked ""from scratch""? and he said yes. I thought about that one for a while and said I was stumped, not knowing the mathematics behind creating a pseudo random number. When I said that he was annoyed and went on to explain how to call rand(). At this point he was not interested in hearing what I had to say as an explanation or in my defense. The last interviewer shooed me out the door without asking if I needed to use the restroom, or if I had any questions. I note that I am female and the interviewers were all male. Some of the behavior may have been due to bias, or perhaps those people were simply biased against anyone new! There were very few women at that office though, 7 out of 200 engineers or something like that. Hopefully things have improved since then, but at that point I decided that Google was not a good fit and that I likely would not interview with them again.",Google

However, in 10 minutes, it turned out to be implementing/overriding a function in java String class. It was kind of weird. And then, at last, when he told me that what questions I would like to ask him, I said ""Could you tell me something about your team? And how long have you been working in Google?"" Pretty normal questions, right? However, then, he was like ""It seems like you are doing a survey!"" WT...His replies really made me feel quite uncomfortable.

The recruiter was a bit ""jerky"" and was trying to pressure me into accepting the offer by implying that every other software company was a poor decision to consider. I felt like Google's unwillingness to negotiate the salary at all hinted at a larger ""big corporate"" problem that would likely be an issue throughout employment there.

When I did, it was to let me know that the next step was a 45 minute (approx.) phone interview that would test my critical thinking and process skills. They asked me three hypothetical questions.

I was then called back for a final in-person interview during which I met three or four higher-ups over the period of approximately 3.5 hours, no break.

He finished by asking me to send him an email of articles I've written in bullet point form. And that's it. Haven't heard back, despite a few follow-up emails.

The next phone interview was scheduled with the manager of the position I was applying for, and we talked more about the position and he asked me some logic questions (how many houses are painted red in Canada?, etc). The talk went well, and he said that it looked like I had a good resume to match the position. An on site interview was scheduled for three weeks away, and I asked for the day off work ahead of time, and read up on AdWords and AdSense extensively, but then on the day before the interview, they called to say that it had to be cancelled because of a recent staff meeting with senior management, and that they no longer wanted to fill the open position. It was very unexpected, and I was bummed out after all the planning ahead for this interview, but that's life!

I heard back within a few days to schedule an onsite interview with 3-4 people. I ended up only having 2 onsite interviews since the third person was on a vacation. My recruiter was a no show, so someone else helped me out. The technical interview felt off topic for the position and didn't go well. Overall, the process made me like Google less and I wonder how a company this big can have such a flawed process. After my messy onsite day, I was assigned a new recruiter who was very helpful, so I guess it was just bad luck! Since I like Google and the products, I'd apply again!",Google

The final group interview request came from a group that I never would have applied to directly (and after I had taken another job). I went simply out of curiosity to see the rest of the Google process. As it turned out, one of the interviewers is someone whose work I've admired a long time, which turned things around.

 What is the best way to distribute accounts to your account managers?   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"A Google recruiter contacted me via e-mail and I responded back and we schedule an interview. I had an interview with the recruiter which covered my resume and details about my work history. The recruiter was very positive and provided me several links to learn more about the position I was being considered for as well as a video on YouTube of what it is like to work at Google. After signing a NDA on the details of the specific position I had a second phone interview with the Director of the group which went well and focused on a specific skills set from a previous company that he was interested in. I was then flown out for 3 back to back 30 minute interviews. I met with a marketing manager, account manager, and operational manager. I had a really positive interview experience but I did not get the job. I was surprised as one of the interviewers advised they were certain they would see me back on campus in a week or two. The interview questions that were difficult were not ones you could prepare for as they seem to be generated by the important questions managers and leadership are asking themselves about the business. After the interview I had a slight feeling of having been used as a consultant. I thought this was actually a very good way of seeing how people might offer something new from their own experience with these issues as well as an opportunity to see how a candidate thinks on his feet. If you are an account manager be prepared to talk about account management in an intelligent way. If you were a sales manager prepare to talk about how you assign accounts and how you might improve the tools used for account management.",Google

It was a pretty standard interview; lots of questions about my experience, which I thought well-suited me for the position. They did throw a few bizarre math questions at me, and, having read up on the Google interview process, I thought they wanted to see how I'd reason my way to an answer.

There's a big castle that is Google and everyone you encounter is a guard at the gate. They don't offer much insight, but expect you to jump through hoops countless times for access. Weeks long phone / email interaction with recruiter wanting details on every piece of my background. Then a phone interview with a decision maker. Then a flight out to SF. A series of highly structured interviews during a grueling day. Very challenging interviews--you've got to think on your feet and be uber prepared! That is not my beef. I welcome that challenge and respect the fact that they only want the best of the best. But I would implore Google to add more transparency/collaboration to the process.

However, they dont share any feedback ever, and the process lasted six months with 12 interviews in total. Their interview questions were thoughtful and meaty, and you have to know your stuff when you are interviewing with them. However, they dont build on the answers, and one has the impression they have a drop down menu memeorized in their heads of the questions to ask, and they write the answers down, but they are not necessarily considering the answer. Their office space in NY and CA is very cool, and they try hard to keep it that way.

The second phone interview consisted of technical questions including SQL joins and talking about some research I did for school. Before the third phone interview, I was instructed to do an Excel exercise that would be discussed in my third phone interview. The third phone interview consisted of more technical questions and brain teasers, but no mention or discussion of the Excel exercise.

I did very well on the test and then they didn't get back to me about the interview for months, because the position they were considering me for was not quite ready. It was a new branch within the company. Finally, after 2 months of waiting the recruiter got back to me, apologized for the delay and scheduled an interview at their NY office.

 What were your SAT scores?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I had two brief interviews with Google's legal department. The first one was a pre-screen with a recruiter, and it lasted about 30 minutes. The recruiter was very nice, asked a lot of substantive questions and scheduled the next round to interview with someone more senior in the department. I had a quick phone screen wiht that person. It was a very rushed interview and seemed immediately obvious that I did not have the experience this particular person was hoping I would have (and which I never claimed to have had, either in person or on my resume). I never heard from them again. Many of my friends and colleagues have interviewed at Google, to varying degrees of success, and I am told that it's an excruciating process. My impression is that they didn't have a clear idea of what kind of experience they were looking for for this particular role, and it had been a posting that had been up for a very long time, which indicates that there is disagreement on what the candidate profile should look like.",Google

 Are you sure your GPA is over 3.0? Because we get a lot of people and find out later they don't have even the 3.0.   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I would describe the interview process as a big letdown. I was so excited to even be considered for such a prestigous place. First the recruiter did a phone interview and asked me to come in to meet with others. On the day of the interview the recruiter didn't come into work and didn't even bother to email or call to let me know. As a result I sat in the conference room alone for 30 minutes waiting. I was right near one of the famous cafeterias so the building had an sadly familar smell of school lunch. Too much food lying around for my tastes, it looked sloppy, collegiate and the people I met with seem so bored by the whole thing. I really got the feeling I wasn't worthy. I knew I had the experience but something was off maybe that I had attended a State University in California. I have 20 years experience but they put a lot of emphasis on GPA. A lot of young workers in bean bags chairs who looked overfed and who can blame them with all the freebies? Some of them are really crossing the line with such casual dress wearing pajama bottoms beat up flip flops, no need to run a comb through your hair for the office any more? I didn't get any follow up and never heard from the recruiter again. Perhaps she is one of the ones recently laid off because she wasn't too much into her job.",Google

 Q: How do you manage a complex program that consists of multiple projects?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Applied online (with internal referral). Got the invitation for the recruiter's screening in about 10 days. Recruiter was sharp, efficient and on-point. The invitation for the first interview round followed. All very professional, with the recruiter's support. Interview itself was a disaster. The interviewer was very dry (borderline rude), it was by no means a conversation, rather felt like a police interrogation. Minimum eye contact, interviewer was just taking down the notes. Questions for the role in the particular team were theoretical and very generic (at some point I even got worried, that they confused the interviews, and that one was for a different role). Also those questions had quite little to do with competencies listed in the job description. Interviewer seemed to be clearly disappointed that I did not have experience with ""multi-billion projects that are of Google scale"", even though this was not a role requirement and my resume does not say that I do have such experience. About 20 minutes into the interview I wanted to finish the interview myself. The few questions that I had about the role/team were answered in generic 1-2 sentence (nothing more detailed than the publicly available information). As the interviewer did not show any interest in me as a potential candidate, this is why I am not surprised by zero of follow-up from the recruiter (even though this is something that is a regular step in rejection). I am not sure if I will want to apply to Google again, but one thing for sure -- I would not want to be my interviewer's teammate.",Google

 Tell me about the time you had to make a decision without a complete information or no procedure in place   ,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"Market Specialist (Trust and Safety) for Youtube. 1 stage was a screening with the recruiter. 2nd stage was a 1:1 video interview with the member of trust and safety department (peer) and this is where my interview ended despite really solid, I'd say good interview, and this is the stage where I do have my concerns which I am going to share now. The whole process from the candidate experience was really good, the recruiter looked after me from the very beginning till the end including phone rejection call. This position was really something I was keen on and had some high hopes about. I do posses a rich experience when it comes to job interviews, particularly at tech/social media companies so I can compare and evaluate all the aspects of this particular interview very well, including my performance. I answered all 10 questions, most of them very well/on point, 1 or maximum 2 a bit weaker but still decent answers. My total passing threshold of 1:1 interviews prior to panel/onsite interview stage (all interviews at tech companies I have had in my life) is 85% (which is quite high). Unfortunately it didn't work out this time and it's strange because I felt I had a good interview, my recruiter even confirmed it during the rejection (!?) that most of my answers were good. After having 10 interviews at tech companies within last 2 years I can tell - and this is my feedback to the recruiters: there is significantly harder to pass 1:1 interview prior onsite if the interviewer is a regular employee / peer (non-managerial role). A passing threshold for me when the interviewee is a peer is approx 55% (compared to overall 85%). This was the case this time with YT as well. I always wonder why companies trust so much in quality of such hiring decisions these days. There is even no way to verify what has been input into feedback section by my interviewer who is not a a pro recruiter/interviewer or a manager. They can wrote almost anything, they can make up stuff or consciously misinterpret things to help their preferred candidates get shortlisted instead. I am not saying my interviewer cheated, but I would like to point it out as this is the trend these days and I know from internal sources ( I work in social media company) there are easy ways to consciously ""sink"" the candidate by selectively inputting interview feedback (missing strong points of interviewee's answers purposefully) , giving too much objective opinions + making up things to justify it, that had never been said by the interviewee etc ... no one is going to verify it if it's 1:1 interview! and even if , it's always easy to make an excuse ""ohh I misinterpreted him"". It is really sad because people like me prepare a lot for each interview, it is emotionally draining and nothing hurts more than unfair rejection and a strong feeling that something went wrong on my interviewer's side. I will try again with YouTube in the future if I get the chance but I would love the companies to stop assigning regular peers to interview panel BEFORE the actual onsite stage (any 1:1 stage).",Google

 Variations of standard behavioral/situational questions   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was contacted by an internal recruiter at Google to have a brief chat. This was a very simple screening in which I was asked about my background, interests, and logistical questions (am I a US citizen, able to relocate, etc.). I was then forwarded to a hiring manager with whom I had a 30-minute interview via Hangouts. This for me was the toughest interview because I really didn't fully know what to expect and had very little information as to what the HM was looking for. However, I utilized Google's career prep resources, did a lot of industry research, and practiced answering basic situational/behavioral interview questions by writing down at least three answers for each question and practicing them. The goal wasn't to memorize the answers but to get comfortable talking about my history and interests so that I could answer whatever question came up flexibly and fluently. After this interview, it took <48 hours to be updated by my recruiter that I had moved into the next round of on-site interviews, which consisted of 3 half-hour interviews with senior legal staff as well as two 15-minute interviews with senior legal staff from different teams. The interviews with senior staff were almost the same as the first with the hiring manager, though I personally found them to be less stressful. The team member interviews were more casual and questions were generally about my experience and team fit. I was again contacted within <48 hours with the news that I would be moving on to the hiring committee and from then on it was out of my hands. I was notified that I had passed committee about a week later, and then that I had passed the executive committee a few days after that. Finally, an offer was extended.",Google

" What do you think, are the qualities required for this job?   ",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"Got a call from the recruiter and he described me a bit about the role and position. He sent me a prep. guide with some information on the kind of questions and rounds to expect. Then I had 5 rounds of interviews in total, with each round spread over two weeks and the recruiter getting back to me after several days/weeks after the interview. After the first three rounds of interviews, I had the fourth round with the hiring manager. To be honest, at this point, after months of waiting, I was so frustrated with them already, that I felt like quitting or refusing, before it ever happened. This fourth interview perhaps didn't go too well for me and the recruiter got back to me after three weeks of this interview, stating that the hiring manager wasn't quite convinced of me being a fitting match for this particular team. Maybe it could work out for some other teams. After this fourth one, I had another follow up interview with another manager, to see if I could demonstrate some analytical or in-depth problem solving skills. He wasn't also quite convinced of my skills so after a week and many days, the recruiter told me that nothing has changed and I don't seem to be a right fit for the teams they have been interviewing me for. Anyway, I'm happy that the process is over finally, not to mention, the long waits. I must say that the recruiter has been very friendly and supportive of me in the entire process and I very much liked it. I would have rated down the process negative, were it not for his cooperation and friendliness. I read a lot of negatives about the bureaucracy and pathetic interview/recruitment processes at Google and I must say that I was really frustrated to have got into this. I was interviewing for GTech and it seems that their processes and speed is so so inefficient, that during the process, at times, I myself felt refusing the recruiter to proceed with the process, just for the sake of mental peace. They just don't care about how much time the candidate may have to spare and spend on it. They will keep you hanging around for weeks and days upon days, just to tell you that you are not a fit with this team, or nothing has changed. After weeks, they ask you simple questions like ""What qualities do you appreciate in your manager?"". I mean, seriously, you had to make me wait for so many days and weeks, just for me to hear this? Thanks the process is over! Beware and caution to anyone, who might be thinking of getting into this.

 How will you automate billing process to customers?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"It was an astonishingly disappointing experience overall, so much so that I wanted to write this review before the process was over, but anyways waited for it. Couple of weeks after I had applied for the role, I received a mail from Google HR for an initial HR round to understand my profile. It was for around 20 minutes. Thereafter for the next 1 month I had 3 hangout video calls. Well firstly, the seniority of the role was not very clear from the JD and I found out that the hiring manager's qualification was about the same as mine, while the person interviewing me next had less post-qualification experience than me and nearly the same qualification as mine. I still went ahead with the process to see where it leads to. All 3 interviews were very very generic, I did not find any element of ""googleyness"" whatsoever. Most questions were case based or behavioral and almost all of them were related to something I have already been through so it was pretty straightforward. However as luck would have it after 3 weeks from the date of the third interview and after several follow-ups, I was told that I would not be going forward. Even if I did mind the looooooooong wait it's ok if someone is better than me, but the reason provided was pretty strange. I was told that I did not have sufficient project management experience. Firstly, I have been involved with over 300 projects a year over several years now, so I wonder what seemed less to them. Secondly, the profile might have elements of project management but was definitely not a project management profile. Thirdly, I was hardly asked anything related to project management! So the vague interviews were topped off with a vague feedback and overall it was a huge waste of my time. It was not something I expected from a company like Google.",Google

,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I have interviewed with Google (GCP, G Suite) for a number of sales positions over the past year and I can say it is the most backward process for any Enterprise software company I have dealt with in the past twenty years. The recruiters are very junior (less than 5 years in the work force) yet tend to have more power than you can imagine. In multiple positions I was a referral from a Senior Google employee who also helped broker introductions/meetings with hiring managers and collegues prior to formally applying. Despite being told that I would be an excellent candidate, I haven't been able to get through a very basic screening call. The screening calls address anytihng that can be obtained via LinkedIn or your resume. With the recruiters lacking basic industry knowledge and (I imagine) asking the same basic questions all day long, it is not a very engaging call nor does it make you excited about working at Google. At the end of every call, I asked if they have any concerns about my experience and if I would be a good fit. Despite being told that there is ""none"" and I would be an excellent candidate, it takes less than 24 hours before you get an email saying that they are not proceeding with you. I have been told that they only put a few people through the interview process which is either and irresponsible recruiting practice or a blatent lie to me... I imagine it is the latter as this seems to be a Company where dishonestly is more acceptable than potentially hurting someone's feelings. What can I say? I would have loved to work at Google but it is clear after writing this, I might not be ""Googly"" enough for them.",Google

I am wondering why they haven't told me that sooner and kept asking for more information which took a lot of time and effort to gather. The whole process rolled over for a few weeks and I had to keep other companies which made me offers waiting until Google finally made a decision. This really was a negative experience and I think that there are serious problems with the hiring process at Google. Not only do they not feel bad about keeping the candidates waiting for weeks but also ask for other information such as references and team support letters which is pretty unusual for a hiring process for a new grad.

" They give you hypothetical interview questions typical of management consultancies (e.g. estimate the revenue generated from advertising in the banking sector in country XYZ), so better prepare for this type of question.

An interview was supposed to be scheduled with one person, but since he was not available, they scheduled the interview with someone else.

I did all my interviews either by phone, by teleconference or face-to-face. They also gave me a big pile of documents to read about their advertising platform.

A lot of which included CS theory such as OOP and data structures. I was scheduled 2 45-minute interviews. Unlike what I expected, I had to complete 2 programming tasks (one in each interview) with no questions about computer science theory. Under the stress of being in an interview, and due to the expectation of CS theory questions, my mind blanked despite having 2 tasks which I could complete with ease - of course I regret being such an idiot - So long as you focus logically on what you do the interview should be a fairly easy process, although the randomness of the code can throw you off guard.

 I found the system design interview hardest. It's difficult to prepare for and hard to estimate how well you're doing. The only advice I can give is to stay relaxed and talk about the ideas that come to your mind. The interviewer was quite helpful and it was more like brainstorming.   ,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"After an interview workshop run by Google at my university I was contacted a few weeks later by a Google Recruiter. I initially had a 45 minutes phone interview with an engineer answering questions and writing code on a shared Google Doc. After that I was invited for on-site interviews. In total there were 5 interviews of 45 minutes each on that day. 4 of the interviews were mainly about problem solving and coding. The other one was more about system design (no coding, it was just a discussion). All interviews were with engineers.

After initially asking a question on which I fumbled, we spent the remaining time working on one question. The question itself wasn't terribly difficult, but it was intentionally ambiguous, to make sure I asked the right questions. After clearing up details we discussed optimizations, etc. This is probably the part of the interview that was most enjoyable as it didn't really feel like I was getting grilled. It felt as if we were discussing a problem and different approaches we could take. The second interviewer had a bit of an accent and seemed a bit less engaged/helpful.

" The most difficult part was to improve my solution in the second interview, which was not hard by itself, but when put on the spot it is harder to think of another way to solve it.   ",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online where I submitted my CV and was contacted after a day. I was working during that time, so my two phone interviews were scheduled on the same day and the recruiter was really helpful in making sure I can make the time. The phone interviews were 15 minutes apart and the first one had a lot of small questions that required no coding, but rather collaboration on how I might do things as well as questions about data structures. On one of the questions I did not entirely understand what I was asked and the interviewer explained what was expected. The second interview was a single coding exercise. I had to write a solution to a given problem and after I wrote it, I had to explain the complexity of my solution. After that I was asked to improve my algorithm so that it runs faster. The interviewer did not require the code to be compilable, but to show knowledge of the language and the solution. Off the top of my head I did not remember the exact way of doing I/O with files in Java, but that was not a problem. After the interviews I was contacted the following day and the recruiter informed me that I am continuing to the next stage where they search for a project for me. The project was found in a couple of days and I had a phone conversation with the team manager who asked me about my previous experience with some technologies and my availability for the needed dates.

I knew it would be a difficult set of interviews, and so I began preparing/studying weeks in advance. It didn't really matter. For all Google's talk about it's unique corporate culture and how much they value finding employees that are the right ""fit"", I was a bit offended at just how impersonal the process was. The questions had no connection to my qualifications, experiences, and interests. Rather, I was drilled on abstract issues that seemed more intent on discovering how many facts I could spew out rather than how I approached a particular business problem. With the style of questioning, I felt like I was being set up to fail. I would answer a question, and the interviewer would keep pushing the issue with narrower and narrower follow-up questions until I had no choice but to admit, ""I'm not sure."" Only then would they switch to a fresh topic. For example, a line of questioning about renewable energy markets eventually ended up on ""Tell me the difference between AC and DC power transmission."" None of this seems like it would have any impact on my ability to do the job. A friend had given me some advice... to do well in the interview, it's important to ""Show What You Know""... and I found that to be accurate.

Only one of the persons was someone in the group I was applying for and everyone else worked in groups under the same overall organization. 75% of the questions had nothing to do with the job description and was relevant to their job. The analogy that I would use is to ask someone applying for an auto mechanic job questions relevant to the stereo because it's in the car. That's not their job and why does it matter? Anyway, I still answered many of the questions because of past experiences but there were some that I didn't know. There was the ""Googley"" question that I feared and unfortunately, I failed (miserably). I'm sure that's why I didn't get an offer although I felt very good about my technical responses.

" (analytical phone interview) What would occur on earth if the sun ""went out""?   ",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"As many of my peers have experienced, the interview/recruitment process at Google can seem very lengthy and convoluted. There is little coordination between recruiters for different jobs, so if interviewing for more than one position at a time it's very difficult to understand what the internal process is. It seems that one gets ""passed"" from one recruiter to another, then can't obtain a response from the original recruiter, and if a new position opens up that seems like a good fit, recruiters will not respond to inquiries. So, if you make it through numerous interviews successfully with positive feedback, even from a department head, you aren't kept on a ""flagged"" list of people who would actually be a good fit for future openings. You'll need to start from scratch again and hope that your resume gets noticed. The employee referral process is also not made transparent to applicants.

 We like creative people here. How have you been creative in your role?   ,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,It seemed quite vague. I was approached based on a contact I had there and had an initial HR screening discussion / interview by phone. That was followed with a conversation (by phone) with a person that I never subsequently met in person and who was a little short / blunt with her questions on the phone. I expected to meet her later but never did. Those calls were then followed with 3 short interviews during one day with 3 different personnel from different areas / departments. I got the feeling they were generally fishing rather than considering me for a specific role. One (the most senior of the 3) was a bit blunt or rude and seemed to be making a point of spending as little time as possible. He asked a couple of vague questions or almost made comments that could be open to either positive or negative interpretations regardless of the response I gave. It seemed a bit disorganised and overall not a very pleasant experience.,Google
